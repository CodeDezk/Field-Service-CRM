## Purpose

This handbook is the public source of truth for the Field Service CRM product. It must allow a new
engineer or coding agent to understand the product before reading or writing application code.

The project follows this sequence:

```text
Product vision
  -> assumptions and decisions
  -> organization and tenancy model
  -> field-service workflows
  -> business capabilities
  -> domain model
  -> business rules
  -> system requirements
  -> solution architecture
  -> technical proofs
  -> roadmap and work breakdown
  -> implementation
  -> validation
  -> release
```

Implementation must follow accepted product behavior and architecture. It must not silently define
them.

## Document authority

Authority is ordered as follows:

1. Owner-stated product constraints recorded in this handbook.
2. Accepted decisions and business rules.
3. Accepted system requirements.
4. Accepted architecture decisions, when they exist.
5. Work-package authorization.
6. Implementation details.

When lower-level material conflicts with a higher-level authority, stop and reconcile the conflict
before proceeding.

## Status language

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Draft | Incomplete working material |
| Proposed | A candidate requiring owner review |
| Owner-stated | Directly supplied as a governing product fact by the owner |
| Accepted | Approved as the current product or engineering standard |
| Deferred | Valid idea intentionally postponed |
| Rejected | Considered and not selected |
| Superseded | Replaced by a newer identified record |

Document presence does not imply acceptance.

## Current product statement

Field Service CRM is a configurable multi-tenant platform for organizations that sell, schedule,
deliver, document, and manage work at customer locations.

The first domain is Myanmar air-conditioning service. The core product must support residential
and commercial customers, crew-based fieldwork, dynamic on-site diagnosis, installations,
services, repairs, equipment history, inventory, quotations, contracts, external payment evidence,
and organizational control from small businesses through multi-branch enterprises.

## Current phase gate

Product Discovery exits only when:

- the target product and boundaries are accepted;
- the multi-organization and tenant-isolation model is accepted;
- major workflow families and exception outcomes are represented;
- core business capabilities and concepts use consistent language;
- governing business rules are identified;
- system requirements are testable and traceable;
- architecture-significant uncertainties are listed for technical proof;
- no unresolved contradiction prevents architecture work.

Passing Product Discovery authorizes architecture work, not application implementation.

## WP-00 acceptance

The owner accepted the repository and Product Discovery documentation bootstrap on 2026-09-30.
This acceptance confirms the handbook structure, agent rules, private/public control boundary, and
initial draft baseline. It does not accept every Draft requirement, Proposed decision, Proposed
business rule, workflow detail, architecture choice, or implementation scope.

## WP-01 authorization

The owner authorized `WP-01 Product Vision and Boundaries` on 2026-09-30 and explicitly kept
application coding closed. WP-01 may refine the product definition, target organizations, supported
operating models, product surfaces, scope layers, non-goals, success outcomes, and decision
register. It does not authorize architecture selection, application scaffolding, dependencies,
deployment, or external-system changes.

## WP-01 acceptance

silently accept later workflow, domain, business-rule, system-requirement, or architecture work.

## WP-02 authorization

After verified WP-01 publication, the owner authorized activation of `WP-02 Multi-Organization
Foundation` and kept application coding closed. WP-02 defines platform and tenant authority,
organization lifecycle, membership and worker identity, branches, roles and access scope,
configuration inheritance, platform organization visibility, controlled support sessions, data
ownership classes, and tenant delivery profiles. It does not select implementation technology.

execution, application coding, dependencies, deployment, and external-system changes remain
closed.

## WP-13 acceptance and owner decisions

The owner accepted WP-13 on 2026-10-01 and authorized publication. `QBD-001` through `QBD-015`
are accepted as architecture-evaluation baselines, not customer SLAs or production commitments.
`EVAL-BASE-001` through `EVAL-BASE-012` are accepted while monetary budget `OPEN-088` and
geography/residency `OPEN-089` remain open. `SHORTLIST-001` advances as the primary evaluation
profile, `SHORTLIST-002` remains comparative, `SHORTLIST-003` is deferred, and
`SHORTLIST-004` is rejected for the initial architecture. `ADR-DISP-001` through
`ADR-DISP-015` are accepted as the review/proof classification. Final architecture selection,
technical-proof execution, application coding, dependencies, deployment, and external-system
changes remain closed.

## WP-14 authorization

After verified WP-13 publication, the owner authorized `WP-14 Technology Category and
Provider-Neutral Candidate Evaluation` for documentation and option analysis only. WP-14 may
compare provider-neutral client, application/runtime, API, identity, operational data, offline,
media, background work, reporting, observability, deployment, and recovery categories against the
accepted evaluation baselines and Profiles 001/002. Final architecture selection, named-provider
commitment, technical-proof execution, application coding, dependencies, deployment, and
external-system changes remain closed.

## WP-14 acceptance

The owner accepted WP-14 on 2026-10-07 and authorized publication. Acceptance confirms the six
evaluation principles, twenty provider-neutral technology-category dispositions, two coherent
category sets, named-candidate entry requirements, risks, and defer/reject boundaries as the
baseline for named-candidate analysis. It does not select a provider, product, framework,
dependency, database, runtime, client technology, deployment topology, or final architecture;
execute a technical proof; or authorize application coding or deployment. After verified
publication, WP-15 may document owner planning decisions and analyze named candidates only.

## WP-15 authorization

After verified WP-14 publication, the owner authorized `WP-15 Budget, Geography, Team Fit and
Named Candidate Shortlist` on 2026-10-07 for owner decision documentation and named-candidate
analysis only. WP-15 may recommend explicit budget, geography/residency, team-fit, and client
platform baselines; inspect dated official provider/product evidence; and narrow candidates for a
later decision or proof package. It may not select a final architecture or dependency, execute a
technical proof, install dependencies, write application code, create infrastructure, deploy, or
change an external system.

## WP-15 acceptance

The owner accepted all WP-15 recommendations and dispositions exactly as recorded on 2026-10-07
and authorized publication. `BUDGET-BASE-001` through `006`, `GEO-BASE-001` through `006`,
`TEAM-BASE-001` through `006`, and `CLIENT-BASE-001` through `005` become accepted architecture-
evaluation baselines. The `NAMED-TECH-*`, `NAMED-PROV-*`, and `NAMED-SET-*` dispositions are
accepted shortlist controls, not final technology or architecture selections. After verified
publication, WP-16 may specify named-candidate proofs and architecture-decision readiness only.
Technical-proof execution, dependency installation, application coding, final architecture
selection, infrastructure creation, and deployment remain closed.

## WP-16 authorization

After verified WP-15 publication, the owner authorized `WP-16 Named Candidate Proof
Specifications and Architecture Decision Readiness` on 2026-10-07 for documentation and proof
planning only. WP-16 may define bounded proof specifications, synthetic fixtures, pass/fail
criteria, evidence and review requirements, cost/duration controls, sequencing, cleanup, and the
evidence needed for each candidate architecture decision. It may not authorize or execute a proof,
open or change a provider account, incur cost, install a dependency, create executable code or
infrastructure, select a final architecture, deploy, or use customer/live data.

## WP-16 acceptance

The owner accepted WP-16 on 2026-10-07 and authorized publication. Acceptance confirms the proof
state model, common proof contract, comparable-candidate envelope, synthetic fixtures, twelve proof
specifications, WP-15 proof traceability, evidence and review plan, proof-wave dependencies,
cost/cleanup controls, fifteen architecture-decision readiness rows, evidence-packet requirements,
selection-readiness rules, risks, unresolved inputs, and the `NOT_READY` selection verdict.
`DEC-123` through `DEC-126` become accepted proof-governance baselines. Acceptance does not
authorize any proof, executable artifact, dependency, provider account, cost, infrastructure,
final architecture selection, application coding, deployment, or customer/live-data use.

## WP-17 authorization

After verified WP-16 publication, the owner authorized `WP-17 Proof Governance Decisions and First
Technical Proof Authorization` on 2026-10-07 for owner decision documentation only. WP-17 may
recommend proof-evidence thresholds, reviewer independence, proof-account/cost controls, the first
proof candidate, its bounded synthetic policy and future execution contract, stop conditions, and
the exact later authorization gate. It may not authorize or execute the proof, create a harness or
schema, install dependencies, open or modify accounts, incur cost, create infrastructure, select a
final architecture, write application code, deploy, or use customer/live data.

## WP-17 acceptance

The owner accepted every WP-17 recommendation and disposition exactly as recorded on 2026-10-07
and authorized publication. `PGD-001` through `PGD-010` and `DEC-128` through `DEC-134` become
accepted proof-governance and first-proof authorization-planning baselines. Acceptance confirms
the evidence threshold, independent role model, TP-01 priority and local/synthetic boundary,
proof-only policy, zero-tolerance tenant outcome, disposable-artifact rule, non-passing outcomes,
and separate exact execution authorization. It does not authorize TP-01 execution, a harness,
schema, dependency installation, local service, provider account, cost, infrastructure, final
architecture selection, application coding, deployment, or customer/live-data use.

## WP-18 authorization

After verified WP-17 publication, the owner authorized `WP-18 TP-01 Exact Execution Contract` on
2026-10-07 for owner decision documentation and authorization-readiness only. WP-18 may inspect
read-only local tool availability and current official lifecycle/package/image evidence; recommend
exact proof-only versions, paths, dependency inventory, local environment, synthetic case matrix,
commands, resource limits, evidence, reviewers, cleanup, and remaining blockers; and issue an
execution-readiness verdict. It may not create proof artifacts, resolve/install dependencies,
download/start a container image, run TP-01, open or modify provider accounts, incur cost, create
infrastructure, select final architecture, write application code, deploy, or use customer/live
data.

## WP-18 acceptance

The owner accepted every WP-18 recommendation and disposition exactly as recorded on 2026-10-07
and authorized publication. `TP1-DEC-001` through `TP1-DEC-010` and `DEC-136` through `DEC-142`
become accepted TP-01-only contract baselines. Acceptance confirms the exact direct tool/package
versions, database image digest, proof/evidence paths, context and schema meanings, enforcement
modes, 222-case matrix, resource/network limits, command interfaces, evidence, two checkpoints,
cleanup, risks, and `NOT_READY` execution verdict. It does not create or install the proof,
authorize materialization or execution, accept a final architecture/dependency, create application
code or infrastructure, deploy, or permit customer/live data.

## WP-19 authorization

After verified WP-18 publication, the owner authorized `WP-19 TP-01 Materialization and
Supply-Chain Review` on 2026-10-07. WP-19 may create only the accepted disposable inventory under
`proofs/tp-01-tenant-boundary/`, generate the 222-case manifest and exact pnpm lockfile, install the
accepted proof-only dependencies with lifecycle scripts disabled, produce private materialization
and supply-chain evidence, perform static/non-proof inventory checks, and use one independent
subagent to validate checkpoint 1. It may not pull/start PostgreSQL, create/apply a database or
schema, bind an application/database port, start HTTP/background processes, execute TP-01 cases,
make proof-result claims, write application code, create provider accounts or paid services,
create infrastructure, select final architecture, or deploy.

## WP-19 checkpoint-1 result

Checkpoint 1 materialized exactly 50 non-dependency files under the accepted disposable proof
path. The proof package and lockfile hashes, 222-case manifest, dependency tree, licenses,
advisories, and file inventory are recorded in `22_TP01_MATERIALIZATION_SUPPLY_CHAIN_REVIEW.md`.
Exact-runtime static manifest and TypeScript checks passed, and the one authorized independent
subagent returned PASS for inventory completeness and consistency.

WP-19 passed checkpoint review and is now accepted for publication. TP-01 was not executed. The proof
operator, checkpoint-2 reproduction validator, and qualified security reviewer remain unassigned;
database-image and execution operations remain closed. Publication authority is limited to the
frozen checkpoint inventory.

## WP-19 acceptance

The owner accepted `WP19-DEC-001` through `WP19-DEC-005` and the checkpoint-1 inventory exactly as
recorded on 2026-10-07 and authorized publication. Acceptance freezes the 50-file disposable proof
inventory, package/lock/manifest hashes, dated supply-chain snapshot, and independent inventory
PASS for checkpoint 1 only. It does not authorize TP-01 execution, treat the inventory review as
independent reproduction or qualified security review, select an application architecture or
dependency, create infrastructure, deploy, or permit customer/live data.

After verified publication, the owner authorized activation of `WP-20 TP-01 Execution Roles and
Checkpoint-2 Authorization` for owner decision documentation only. Execution remains closed until
the proof operator, independent reproduction validator, qualified security reviewer, exact
revision, and artifact hashes are explicitly accepted.

## WP-19 publication result

The frozen 55-path WP-19 inventory was committed as
`01bc6d5 WP-19: accept TP-01 checkpoint-1 materialization` and pushed to `origin/main`. Local
`HEAD`, fetched `origin/main`, and `FETCH_HEAD` were verified at
`01bc6d58fb2c8d1c255e79ebf031faaf53fbb304`. No merge, proof execution, database/image/service,
application coding, infrastructure, deployment, customer/live data, or external configuration
change occurred. WP-19 is `VERIFIED_AND_CLOSED`.

## WP-20 authorization

After verified WP-19 publication, the owner activated `WP-20 TP-01 Execution Roles and
Checkpoint-2 Authorization` on 2026-10-07 for owner decision documentation only. WP-20 may bind
the exact published revision and artifact hashes, propose explicit operator and independent
validator assignments, record the missing qualified security reviewer, define independence and
sign-off controls, assess checkpoint-2 readiness, and prepare the exact later execution-
authorization statement. It may not execute preflight or TP-01, alter the frozen proof inventory,
pull or start an image/container, apply SQL, bind ports, start services, create application code or
infrastructure, select final architecture, deploy, or use customer/live data.

## WP-20 readiness result

WP-20 binds checkpoint 2 to verified commit
`01bc6d58fb2c8d1c255e79ebf031faaf53fbb304`, proof-tree identity, package/lock/case-manifest
hashes, the private 50-entry inventory digest, and the contracted image digest. It proposes the
primary repository agent as operator and a fresh independent reproduction subagent under explicit
separation controls. It does not fabricate the remaining qualified security reviewer.

WP-20 reached `READY_FOR_OWNER_DECISION`; checkpoint 2 remained `NOT_READY` and `NOT_AUTHORIZED`.
At that gate, a named qualified security reviewer and explicit owner dispositions remained
blocking. No proof-root change, preflight, image/container/database/service, TP-01 execution,
application code, infrastructure, deployment, customer/live data, WP-20 staging, commit, or push
occurred.

## WP-20 acceptance and unresolved execution authorization

The owner accepted `WP20-DEC-001` through `WP20-DEC-008` and `TP1-BIND-001` through
`TP1-BIND-007` exactly as recorded on 2026-10-07 and authorized WP-20 publication. The operator and
independent-reproduction role classes are accepted under their stated separation controls.

The supplied security-reviewer name and qualification remained literal placeholders. They do not
identify or qualify a reviewer. Therefore `TP1-ROLE-004`, `TP1-AUTH-005`, and `TP1-AUTH-009`
remain blocking, the attempted checkpoint-2 authorization was invalid under the accepted WP-20
contract, and WP-21 was not activated at that gate. TP-01 execution remains closed.

## WP-20A owner-directed governance amendment

On 2026-10-07 the owner directed a narrow revision for the solo-development context: an independent
security-review subagent may perform TP-01's technical security review, while qualified human
security review is deferred but remains mandatory before production deployment or any real/customer
data. All other WP-20 controls remain unchanged.

The assigned technical security-review identity is `/root/tp01_security_review`. It is separate
from the primary operator and the future reproduction validator and is prohibited from authoring,
operating, reproducing, or mutating TP-01. This amendment does not itself authorize checkpoint 2,
activate WP-21, run a command, accept a proof result, or authorize production.

## WP-20A validation result

The assigned `/root/tp01_security_review` subagent confirmed its read-only, no-author,
no-operator, no-validator scope and accepted the assignment as conditionally suitable for local
synthetic TP-01 only. It confirmed that human production/real-data review must remain mandatory.

Its static review also found three checkpoint-2 evidence blockers: the harness records the expected
database role as a literal instead of measuring the connected role; the evidence verifier checks
only result/audit/reproduction files rather than the complete authorization/environment/image/
fixture/state/cleanup/reviewer packet; and dedicated environment, fixture, and state-integrity
artifacts are not clearly emitted. Local inspection confirmed those findings.

Before owner acceptance, WP-20A reached `READY_FOR_OWNER_DECISION`, while checkpoint 2 remained
`NOT_READY` and `NOT_AUTHORIZED`. Changing the frozen proof to close these gaps changes accepted
hashes and requires a separately authorized remediation/materialization review before execution.

## WP-20A acceptance

The owner accepted `WP20A-DEC-001` through `WP20A-DEC-005`, `TP1-GOV-EX-001` through `005`, and
`TP1-SEC-STATIC-001` through `003` exactly as recorded on 2026-10-07 and authorized publication.
After verified publication, WP-21 may remediate and rematerialize only the disposable TP-01
evidence mechanics, governing documentation, and private evidence. TP-01 execution, images,
containers, databases, services, application coding, final architecture selection, infrastructure,
deployment, and customer/live data remain closed.

## WP-20A publication result

The exact seven-document WP-20A inventory was committed as
`03f0425 WP-20A: accept TP-01 security review amendment` and pushed to `origin/main`. Local
`HEAD`, fetched `origin/main`, and `FETCH_HEAD` were verified at
`03f0425b4089ae1c0173ac911a2f23461eeb6a92`. No proof artifact changed in that publication, and no
execution, runtime resource, application code, infrastructure, deployment, or customer/live data
was involved. WP-20A is `VERIFIED_AND_CLOSED`.

## WP-21 authorization

After verified WP-20A publication, the owner activated `WP-21 TP-01 Evidence Completeness
Remediation and Rematerialization` on 2026-10-07. WP-21 may change only the disposable TP-01 proof,
governing documentation, and ignored private evidence needed to measure actual database identity,
emit dedicated environment/fixture/state-integrity evidence, verify the complete evidence packet,
renew all artifact hashes, and obtain one fresh independent inventory validation.

WP-21 may perform syntax, manifest, TypeScript, hash, inventory, and documentation validation. It
may not execute preflight or TP-01, pull or inspect an image, start a container, create or access a
database, apply SQL, create a fixture, bind a port, start a service, install dependencies, write
application code, select final architecture, create infrastructure, deploy, or use customer/live
data. Publication and checkpoint-2 execution each require a later explicit owner gate.

## WP-21 validation result

WP-21 rematerialized 51 proof files while leaving the lockfile, dependency set, SQL/schema/seed,
runtime/image pins, and 222-case manifest unchanged. Exact-runtime JavaScript syntax, manifest, and
TypeScript no-emit checks passed. The first independent inventory pass found four static defects;
the proof was corrected, all hashes were renewed, and the same single authorized independent
validator returned PASS for 51/51 file/hash consistency and static evidence completeness.

This PASS does not establish database identity, tenant isolation, evidence generation, cleanup
effectiveness, or any TP-01 result because no execution-facing command ran. WP-21 is
accepted for publication, and checkpoint 2 remains `NOT_AUTHORIZED`.

## WP-21 acceptance

The owner accepted WP-21, `WP21-REM-001` through `WP21-REM-005`, and the rematerialized 51-file
proof inventory exactly as recorded on 2026-10-07. Publication is authorized only for the frozen
18-path public inventory. This acceptance does not establish a runtime proof result, restore the
expired WP-20 binding, or authorize checkpoint 2, dependencies, images, containers, databases,
services, application code, final architecture selection, infrastructure, deployment, or
customer/live data.

After verified publication, WP-22 may prepare the exact committed revision/tree/hash binding and
checkpoint-2 authorization decision for owner review only. Execution remains separately closed.

## WP-21 publication result

The exact 18-path WP-21 public inventory was committed as
`e824139 WP-21: accept TP-01 evidence rematerialization` and pushed to `origin/main`. Local `HEAD`,
fetched `origin/main`, and `FETCH_HEAD` were verified at
`e824139d3050e98c06e39d3663ddcae6ac1d02db`. The committed proof tree is
`48ef14bb579d0e4b620dad7c7ef6f8c409445050`. WP-21 is `VERIFIED_AND_CLOSED`.

No TP-01 command, dependency operation, image/container/database/service, application code,
architecture selection, infrastructure, deployment, or customer/live-data operation occurred.

## WP-22 authorization

After verified WP-21 publication, the owner activated `WP-22 TP-01 Rematerialized Binding and
Checkpoint-2 Authorization Decision` on 2026-10-07 for owner-decision documentation only. WP-22
may bind the exact published revision, proof tree, artifact/package/lock/manifest hashes, unchanged
image/runtime contract, role requirements, command order, evidence gates, and an exact future
checkpoint-2 authorization statement.

WP-22 may not create `authorization.json`, appoint or start an execution subagent, run preflight or
any proof/runtime command, install dependencies, use images/containers/databases/services, write
application code, select final architecture, create infrastructure, deploy, or use customer/live
data.

## WP-22 acceptance

The owner accepted `WP22-DEC-001` through `WP22-DEC-008` and `TP1-REBIND-001` through
`TP1-REBIND-010` exactly as recorded on 2026-10-07 and authorized publication of the frozen
seven-path public inventory. The replacement binding is accepted; checkpoint 2 remains separately
closed. After verified publication, WP-23 may instantiate one fresh reproduction-validator identity
and prepare the private checkpoint-2 authorization decision for owner review only.

## WP-22 publication result

The frozen seven-path WP-22 public inventory was committed as
`291aedd WP-22: accept TP-01 rematerialized binding` and pushed to `origin/main`. Local `HEAD`,
fetched `origin/main`, and `FETCH_HEAD` were verified at
`291aedd07c35991c7c677d9e7f94f5f3bc444e61`. WP-22 is `VERIFIED_AND_CLOSED`.

## WP-23 authorization

After verified WP-22 publication, the owner activated `WP-23 TP-01 Execution Identity
Instantiation and Checkpoint-2 Authorization` for owner-decision documentation and private
authorization preparation only. Exactly one fresh reproduction-validator subagent may be created
and recorded. WP-23 may prepare, but not activate, an execution authorization record.

Preflight, dependencies, images, containers, databases, services, TP-01 execution, application
coding, final architecture selection, infrastructure, deployment, and customer/live data remain
closed. WP-23 publication requires the separate owner acceptance recorded below.

## WP-23 acceptance

The owner accepted `WP23-DEC-001` through `WP23-DEC-010`, `TP1-EXEC-BIND-001` through `005`,
the fresh-validator attestation, and the ineffective private draft exactly as recorded on
2026-10-07. Commit/push is authorized only for the frozen seven-path public inventory. WP-24 may
activate only after verified publication under the exact separate execution statement.

## WP-23 publication and WP-24 result

WP-23 was published and remotely verified at
`73b12c2b66b898eb9a43e34d08c6f7d07e84dc43`. WP-24 then activated under the exact controlled
checkpoint-2 boundary and stopped on its first preflight because the proof process resolved Node
`v26.3.1` instead of accepted `v22.23.1`; the pnpm launcher separately reported `v24.19.0`.

No image, container, database, service, fixture, proof case, or reproduction ran. Mandatory cleanup
passed. A later final-verifier invocation correctly rejected the incomplete packet but its pnpm
launcher unexpectedly rematerialized 115 packages from the local store before the verifier ran.
Repeated cleanup removed them. All three reviews and the final disposition are `INCONCLUSIVE`.
WP-24 is closed without retry and establishes no tenant-boundary result.

## WP-25 authorization

The owner accepted the WP-24 stop packet and activated WP-25 for proof-only runtime/dependency
launcher remediation and static validation. WP-25 may restore the exact reviewed dependencies
from the existing local store using offline, frozen-lockfile, ignore-scripts controls; correct the
disposable proof launcher and evidence guards; renew all hashes; and use one fresh independent
static validator.

Registry/network access, dependency-version change, preflight, images, containers, databases,
services, TP-01 execution/reproduction, application coding, architecture selection,
infrastructure, deployment, provider accounts/cost, customer/live data, and Git publication remain
closed.

### WP-25 validation result

The exact launcher now verifies the accepted pnpm-entry hash before execution, uses the accepted
Node `v22.23.1` process and pnpm `11.25.0` entry, refuses proof commands when dependencies are
absent, and preserves dependency metadata during static commands. Structured private evidence
records an exact offline/frozen/ignore-scripts restoration rerun with status `0`, no hash drift,
and an isolated missing-dependency refusal with status `1` before pnpm invocation.

The rematerialized proof contains 52 files. Its artifact-inventory SHA-256 is
`0209ca15cc412e6c0f4d7ef06a7ecb4e74e756c678449f0801deb40c1000ac69`; its supplementary
content-set SHA-256 is `052c2349f79ef36a06d8619a0747588b353d67d5b0c9df9e1735474d6f8d4d2d`.
The package, lockfile, and 222-case manifest remain unchanged.

The one authorized independent validator `/root/wp25_static_validator` first returned `FAIL` with
four actionable static findings. After correction and full hash renewal, the same validator
returned `PASS` with no unresolved finding and zero mutations. No preflight, image, container,
database, service, proof, reproduction, application, architecture, infrastructure, deployment,
provider, customer/live-data, commit, or push action occurred. WP-25 is
`READY_FOR_OWNER_REVIEW`.

### WP-25 acceptance and publication result

The owner accepted `WP25-REM-001` through `WP25-REM-009`, `WP25-BIND-001` through
`WP25-BIND-012`, `WP25-DEC-001` through `WP25-DEC-007`, the 52-file proof inventory, and the
independent static-validation `PASS`. The exact 11-path public inventory was committed as
`c588ac4 WP-25: accept TP-01 launcher remediation` and pushed to `origin/main`.

Local `HEAD`, cached `origin/main`, and the live remote main were verified at
`c588ac4e5b4d3307fbc99ffeadbbc3bbaa27bf6b`. The committed proof tree is
`0e6b579811f59e13ff869ec40ea1e3bfd4edea49`. WP-25 is `VERIFIED_AND_CLOSED`.

## WP-26 activation — 2026-10-07

After verified WP-25 publication, the owner activated WP-26 for TP-01 reauthorization-readiness
owner-decision documentation and private authorization preparation only. WP-26 may bind the
published revision/tree and accepted hashes, analyze execution-workspace/dependency-provisioning
options, assess role renewal, and prepare one explicitly ineffective private draft.

Dependency installation/restoration/change, preflight, images, containers, databases, services,
TP-01 execution/reproduction, application coding, final architecture selection, infrastructure,
deployment, provider accounts/cost, customer/live data, Git publication, and external-system
mutation remain closed. WP-26 may not create an effective `authorization.json` or instantiate a
future execution role.

### WP-26 acceptance and publication result

The owner accepted `WP26-DEC-001` through `WP26-DEC-010`, `TP1-REAUTH-BIND-001` through
`TP1-REAUTH-BIND-016`, workspace option `WP26-WS-001`, rejection of `WP26-WS-002/003`, and the
ineffective private draft. The exact five-path public inventory was committed as
`e6ab556 WP-26: accept TP-01 reauthorization readiness` and pushed to `origin/main`.

Local `HEAD`, cached `origin/main`, and live remote main matched
`e6ab556642a2150acaa2002f77fd56b76f24ad6b`. WP-26 is `VERIFIED_AND_CLOSED`.

## WP-27 activation and result — 2026-10-07

The owner authorized one new controlled TP-01 attempt, run `wp27-2026-10-07-01`, in a dedicated
checkout at `c588ac4e5b4d3307fbc99ffeadbbc3bbaa27bf6b`, with one fresh reproduction validator,
exact offline dependency restoration, a new effective private authorization, the recorded
checkpoint-2 sequence, conditional exact-image retrieval, and mandatory cleanup.

Dependencies restored from the existing local store with 115 reused and zero downloaded. The
first preflight then failed closed because Docker Compose reported `5.4.0` while the frozen
contract required `v5.4.0`. No image, container, database, service, fixture, proof case, or
reproduction ran.

The first cleanup call exposed a second defect: Compose required bootstrap-password interpolation
even though no service had started. Cleanup was rerun with a synthetic interpolation-only value and
passed, leaving no dependency or runtime residue. All three reviews are `INCONCLUSIVE`; final
verification correctly rejected the incomplete packet. WP-27 establishes no tenant-boundary
result, is non-retryable, and is `READY_FOR_OWNER_REVIEW`.

## WP-27 acceptance, publication, and WP-28 activation — 2026-10-07

The owner accepted the WP-27 `INCONCLUSIVE` disposition, both deviations, all three role reviews,
mandatory cleanup outcome, fail-closed final-verifier outcome, 16-entry private stop packet,
`WP27-REM-001` through `006`, and `WP27-DEC-001` through `007`. WP-27 was closed without retry.

The frozen five-path public inventory was committed as
`6985851 WP-27: accept TP-01 Inconclusive stop result` and pushed to `origin/main`. Local `HEAD`,
cached `origin/main`, and live remote main matched
`6985851328c86fbe99c1f7a1cb6da615edf7e7c9`.

After verified publication, the owner activated WP-28 for proof-only static remediation of the
optional Compose `v` prefix and the cleanup interpolation interface. WP-28 may change only the
disposable proof, governing documentation, and ignored private static evidence needed for those
two corrections, renewed hashes, and one fresh independent static validation. Dependencies,
preflight, images, containers, databases, services, cleanup execution, proof/reproduction,
application coding, final architecture selection, infrastructure, deployment, provider
accounts/cost, and customer/live data remain closed. WP-28 publication is not authorized.

WP-28 now captures exact Compose stdout, removes only one optional terminal LF/CRLF transport
delimiter, accepts only `5.4.0` or `v5.4.0`, and preserves the raw and normalized forms. Cleanup
uses an in-memory interpolation-only value when no bootstrap value exists, does not retain it, and
remains dependency-free. Exact syntax and pure-contract checks passed. The single fresh independent
validator first found one high-severity stdout-trimming defect; after correction and full hash
renewal, the same validator returned `PASS` with no unresolved finding and zero mutation. The
renewed inventory contains 54 proof files. WP-28 is `READY_FOR_OWNER_REVIEW` and establishes no
runtime, tenant-boundary, or architecture result.

## WP-28 acceptance, publication, and WP-29 activation — 2026-10-07

The owner accepted `WP28-REM-001` through `006`, `WP28-BIND-001` through `012`,
`WP28-DEC-001` through `006`, the 54-file inventory, and the independent static-validation
`PASS`. The frozen nine-path inventory was committed as
`8b4ad94 WP-28: accept Compose cleanup remediation` and pushed to `origin/main`.

Local `HEAD`, cached `origin/main`, and live remote main matched
`8b4ad940ed2b1266b89cbd04f006873d4fe8b407`; the committed proof tree is
`26e1ebf2572b24064fa61963d6db6f656fdc6d09`. WP-28 is `VERIFIED_AND_CLOSED`.

WP-29 is active for owner-decision documentation and private authorization preparation only. It
may bind the exact published remediation, analyze a future dedicated workspace and role renewal,
and prepare an explicitly ineffective private draft. Dependencies, preflight, images, containers,
databases, services, cleanup execution, proof/reproduction, application coding, final architecture
selection, infrastructure, deployment, provider accounts/cost, customer/live data, and WP-29
publication remain closed.

## WP-29 acceptance, publication, and WP-30 result — 2026-10-07

The owner accepted `WP29-DEC-001` through `010`, `TP1-REMEDIATED-BIND-001` through `020`,
advanced `WP29-WS-001`, rejected `WP29-WS-002/003`, and accepted the ineffective draft. The
frozen four-path inventory was committed as `258c225 WP-29: accept TP-01 remediated rebinding` and
pushed to `origin/main`. Local `HEAD`, cached `origin/main`, and live remote main matched
`258c2252769d8a046769ae66f315e6db580464c1`.

WP-30 then activated for run `wp30-2026-10-07-01`. Exact binding, offline dependency restoration,
preflight, accepted-image verification, database start/reset/security capture, and 222-case
manifest verification passed. The single primary test process exited 1 before producing primary
result or audit streams. Failed-child stdout was not retained, so the exact assertion is unknown.
No sealed primary evidence existed and reproduction correctly did not run.

Mandatory cleanup passed and direct residual checks found no resource, process, listener,
dependency, generated output, or credential. All three reviews are `INCONCLUSIVE`. Final
verification also failed closed because its frozen Compose check still expected raw `v5.4.0`
instead of the accepted normalized `5.4.0` plus separate raw evidence. WP-30 establishes no
tenant-boundary or architecture result, is non-retryable, and is `READY_FOR_OWNER_REVIEW`.

## WP-37 acceptance, publication, and WP-38 activation — 2026-10-07

The owner accepted the WP-37 Inconclusive disposition, `WP37-DEV-001`, all three role reviews,
mandatory cleanup and residual verification, fail-closed final verification, the 22-entry private
evidence inventory, `WP37-REM-001` through `007`, and `WP37-DEC-001` through `007`. WP-37 is closed
without retry.

The exact four-path public inventory was committed as
`6482489 WP-37: record controlled conditional image execution` and pushed to `origin/main`. Local
`HEAD`, cached `origin/main`, and live remote main matched
`6482489284daef2f7f250912a94aec9819e10a88`. WP-37 is `VERIFIED_AND_CLOSED`.

WP-38 is active for proof-only static remediation. It may correct the disposable publication
interface, add exact Docker/Compose publisher and loopback-reachability controls, minimize failure
diagnostics, renew proof hashes, and use exactly one fresh independent static validator after
freeze. Dependencies, preflight, images, Docker/Compose runtime, containers, databases, services,
cleanup execution, proof/reproduction, application coding, architecture selection, infrastructure,
deployment, provider accounts/cost, customer/live data, network, and WP-38 publication remain
closed.

WP-38 now expresses exact long-form loopback publication on a dedicated bridge with IP
masquerading disabled, requires Docker/Compose/TCP agreement before database reset, binds that
evidence to the authorized package/run, and redacts local home/worktree paths before bounded
diagnostic retention. Exact Node v22.23.1 syntax and both dependency-free tests pass. The renewed
inventory contains 60 proof files. Fresh validator `/root/wp38_static_validator` returned `PASS`
with no high, medium, or low finding and zero public/proof mutation. Actual Docker publication and
no-egress behavior remain unmeasured. WP-38 is `READY_FOR_OWNER_REVIEW`.

## WP-38 acceptance, publication, and WP-39 activation — 2026-10-07

The owner accepted `WP38-REM-001` through `009`, `WP38-BIND-001` through `018`,
`WP38-DEC-001` through `007`, the renewed 60-file inventory, and the independent
static-validation `PASS`. The frozen fifteen-path inventory was committed as
`ce85144 WP-38: accept host-port reachability remediation` and pushed to `origin/main`.

Local `HEAD`, cached `origin/main`, and live remote main matched
`ce851445a485883fb6f3ec5572508fb0902a4656`; the committed proof tree is
`ad27a2c754b2f7352b3beff314a8e3349758e17a`. WP-38 is `VERIFIED_AND_CLOSED`.

WP-39 is active for owner-decision documentation and explicitly ineffective private
reauthorization preparation only. It binds the verified revision/tree/hashes, preserves all five
stopped-run histories, analyzes future workspace/role/dependency/reachability readiness, and
prepares a draft that cannot satisfy any execution guard. No role was created. Proof changes,
checkout creation, dependencies, preflight, images, Docker/Compose runtime, pull-token creation,
containers, databases, services, listeners, cleanup, proof/reproduction, application coding,
final architecture selection, infrastructure, deployment, provider accounts/cost, customer/live
data, network, and WP-39 publication remain closed. WP-39 is `READY_FOR_OWNER_DECISION`.

## WP-39 acceptance, publication, and WP-40 activation — 2026-10-07

The owner accepted `WP39-DEC-001` through `010`,
`TP1-REACHABILITY-REMEDIATED-BIND-001` through `036`, advanced `WP39-WS-001` and
`WP39-REACH-001`, rejected `WP39-WS-002/003` and `WP39-REACH-002/003`, and accepted the
ineffective private draft. The frozen four-path inventory was committed as
`c120f0d WP-39: accept host-port remediation rebinding` and pushed to `origin/main`.

Local `HEAD`, cached `origin/main`, and live remote main matched
`c120f0d738c93e7ceff75630a5dc678157ff98db`. WP-39 is `VERIFIED_AND_CLOSED`.

WP-40 is active for owner-decision documentation, one fresh reproduction-validator identity and
attestation, and ineffective private authorization preparation only. The exactly one authorized
fresh identity is `/root/wp40_reproduction_validator`; it attested independence, future read-only
scope, and zero current authority or mutation. No second identity was created.

The private draft binds the distinct WP-39 governance publication and WP-38 proof revision/tree,
has no execution package/run/token/checkout, records runtime reachability as unmeasured and
unbypassable, and keeps all 18 authorization gates false. Checkout creation, dependencies,
preflight, images, Docker/Compose, pull-token creation, containers, databases, services, cleanup,
proof/reproduction, application coding, final architecture selection, infrastructure, deployment,
provider accounts/cost, customer/live data, network, and WP-40 publication remain closed. WP-40 is
`READY_FOR_OWNER_DECISION`.

## WP-40 acceptance, publication, and WP-41 result — 2026-10-07

The owner accepted `WP40-DEC-001` through `010`, `TP1-EXEC-REACH-BIND-001` through `011`, the
named roles, fresh-validator attestation, and ineffective private draft. The frozen four-path
inventory was committed as `3a5a404 WP-40: accept execution identity readiness` and pushed to
`origin/main`.

Local `HEAD`, cached `origin/main`, and live remote main matched
`3a5a404cac934af8b4d0397a3da9c09bab3c5068`. WP-40 is `VERIFIED_AND_CLOSED`.

WP-41 activated for run `wp41-2026-10-07-01` at accepted proof revision
`ce851445a485883fb6f3ec5572508fb0902a4656`. The dedicated checkout, exact offline dependency
restoration, effective authorization, preflight, local-first image inspection, and local-cache
image verification passed. The accepted image was already local, so no pull token was created and
no registry or other internet access occurred.

The PostgreSQL service started healthy. The next mandatory command was rejected by the frozen
exact-pnpm launcher because `runtime:verify-reachability` was not in its approved run-script set.
The reachability script never started, so the operator stopped without bypass or retry before
database reset. No primary proof, sealed handoff, or reproduction occurred.

Mandatory cleanup, direct residual verification, and private runtime-credential removal passed.
All three role recommendations are `INCONCLUSIVE`; final verification failed closed on missing
mandatory reachability evidence. The 18-entry private packet has aggregate SHA-256
`cc8b6599ecd96ccf11e44d5f56f23d8c121b4cf0dc3e3036c66d6dc625e68fd8`, and the dedicated
checkout was archived after evidence preservation. WP-41 is `INCONCLUSIVE_CLOSED_NO_RETRY` and
`READY_FOR_OWNER_REVIEW`; it establishes no tenant-boundary, reachability, no-egress, security, or
architecture result.

## WP-41 acceptance, publication, and WP-42 remediation — 2026-10-07

The owner accepted the complete WP-41 Inconclusive disposition, `WP41-DEV-001`, the three role
reviews, mandatory cleanup and residual verification, credential removal, fail-closed final
verification, the 18-entry private inventory, `WP41-REM-001` through `007`, and `WP41-DEC-001`
through `007`. WP-41 was closed without retry.

The frozen four-path public inventory was committed as
`1901f32 WP-41: record controlled reachability execution` and pushed to `origin/main`. Local
`HEAD`, cached `origin/main`, and live remote main matched
`1901f32e157f0fb70af0570dbd739f41dd18a49a`. WP-41 is `VERIFIED_AND_CLOSED`.

WP-42 activated for proof-only static remediation. It adds exactly
`runtime:verify-reachability` to the exact launcher allowlist, reconciles the launcher, package
script, controlled sequence, and final-verifier evidence requirements, adds dependency-free
contract tests, renews the proof hashes, and uses exactly one fresh independent static validator.
Dependencies, preflight, images, Docker/Compose runtime, containers, databases, services, cleanup
execution, proof/reproduction, application coding, architecture selection, infrastructure,
deployment, provider accounts/cost, customer/live data, network, and WP-42 publication remain
closed.

The exact Node v22.23.1 syntax and dependency-free contract checks pass. The renewed proof
inventory contains 62 files. Fresh validator `/root/wp42_static_validator` independently
reproduced every path, byte count, hash, aggregate identity, command-contract control, and frozen
scope and returned `PASS` with zero finding and zero repository mutation. WP-42 is
`READY_FOR_OWNER_REVIEW`; this static result establishes no runtime reachability, tenant boundary,
security acceptance, reproduction, or architecture outcome.

## WP-42 acceptance, publication, and WP-43 activation — 2026-10-07

The owner accepted `WP42-REM-001` through `008`, `WP42-BIND-001` through `016`,
`WP42-DEC-001` through `006`, the renewed 62-file inventory, and the independent static-validation
`PASS`. The frozen nine-path public inventory was committed as
`0f2100b WP-42: accept launcher reachability remediation` and pushed to `origin/main`.

Local `HEAD`, cached `origin/main`, and live remote main matched
`0f2100b869bbb8e466c906b3a0d4213e827ef4cf`; the committed proof tree is
`1777020c393fd3a63134eac99d878b66261523eb`. WP-42 is `VERIFIED_AND_CLOSED`.

WP-43 is active for exact published rebinding and reauthorization-readiness owner-decision
documentation only. It may bind the verified revision/tree and accepted hashes, preserve all
stopped-run history, and analyze workspace, role, launcher, reachability, and future authorization
gates. It does not prepare any private authorization draft. Role creation, checkout creation,
dependencies, preflight, images, Docker/Compose runtime, containers, databases, services, cleanup,
proof/reproduction, application coding, architecture selection, infrastructure, deployment,
provider accounts/cost, customer/live data, network, and WP-43 publication remain closed.

## WP-43 and WP-44 publication and WP-45 result — 2026-10-08

The owner accepted `WP43-DEC-001` through `010`,
`TP1-LAUNCHER-REMEDIATED-BIND-001` through `038`, advanced `WP43-WS-001` and
`WP43-LAUNCH-001`, rejected `WP43-WS-002/003` and `WP43-LAUNCH-002/003`, and accepted the
no-private-draft disposition. The exact four-path public inventory was committed as
`85308d2 WP-43: accept exact launcher rebinding` and pushed to `origin/main`.

Local `HEAD`, cached `origin/main`, and live remote main matched
`85308d2a56993feebd2d10bb97d45aff0735775a`. The accepted proof revision remains
`0f2100b869bbb8e466c906b3a0d4213e827ef4cf` with tree
`1777020c393fd3a63134eac99d878b66261523eb`. WP-43 is `VERIFIED_AND_CLOSED`.

WP-44 created exactly one fresh identity, `/root/wp44_reproduction_validator`, which returned a
`PASS` independence attestation and performed no mutation. The private authorization draft is
explicitly ineffective: it has no execution package, run ID, checkout, token, or credential; all
17 action-authority flags and both effectiveness gates are false; and all six stopped attempts
remain immutable.

The owner accepted all ten WP-44 recommendations, fourteen execution/launcher bindings, the exact
roles, validator attestation, and ineffective private draft. The frozen four-path inventory was
committed as `7c27bb5 WP-44: accept execution identity readiness` and pushed to `origin/main`.
Local `HEAD`, cached `origin/main`, and live remote main matched
`7c27bb50f1becd4b5c808f30aab7d68c277d2458`. WP-44 is `VERIFIED_AND_CLOSED`.

WP-45 then activated for run `wp45-2026-10-08-01` at accepted proof revision
`0f2100b869bbb8e466c906b3a0d4213e827ef4cf`. Exact offline restoration reused 115 packages with
zero downloads; preflight, local-cache image verification, service health, the exact-launcher
three-view reachability gate, synthetic reset/security capture, and the 222-case manifest passed.
No pull token or network access was required.

The primary proof stopped because `TP01_DATABASE_URL` was absent from the private run environment.
Although `127.0.0.1:55432` had passed all three reachability views, node-postgres fell back to its
default endpoint and all 222 executable cases failed `ECONNREFUSED`; only the inventory test
passed. Tracked tenant state remained unchanged. No valid primary packet existed, so reproduction
was correctly skipped.

Mandatory cleanup and direct residual verification passed, and the disposable checkout was
removed. All three role reviews are `INCONCLUSIVE`; the direct-Node final verifier failed closed on
missing `primary-results.jsonl`. The 22-entry private inventory is sealed. WP-45 establishes no
tenant-boundary or architecture result, is non-retryable, and is `READY_FOR_OWNER_REVIEW`.

The owner accepted the complete WP-45 Inconclusive disposition, `WP45-DEV-001` through `003`, all
three role reviews, cleanup and residual verification, fail-closed final verification, the
22-entry private inventory, `WP45-REM-001` through `008`, and `WP45-DEC-001` through `007`.
WP-45 was closed without retry. Its frozen four-path inventory was committed as
`d743809 WP-45: record controlled exact launcher execution` and pushed to `origin/main`. Local
`HEAD`, cached `origin/main`, fetched state, and live remote main matched
`d7438099639b5722b0ef13405235c9b130674104`. WP-45 is `VERIFIED_AND_CLOSED`.

WP-46 is active for bounded proof-only static remediation of the exact run-bound database
connection, its propagation into proof children, accepted-versus-operational deviation evidence,
and minimized executable-path diagnostics. It may add dependency-free static tests, renew the
complete proof inventory, and use exactly one fresh independent static validator after freeze.
Dependencies, preflight, images, Docker/Compose runtime, containers, databases, services, cleanup
execution, proof/reproduction, application coding, architecture selection, infrastructure,
deployment, provider accounts/cost, customer/live data, network, and WP-46 publication remain
closed.

WP-46 now requires the exact canonical database URL and runtime credential to match SHA-256
bindings in the effective private authorization for the same package and run. Both MJS and
TypeScript execution guards require that run, package, effective status, and checkpoint authority;
the proof child receives a dynamic validation marker; final verification binds both non-secret
connection records to the authorization. Accepted contract deviations and operational stops are
separate, and executable diagnostics retain no absolute launcher path or database URL.

Exact-Node syntax and four built-in-only test suites passed. The renewed inventory contains 67
files; artifact inventory is
`e8fb713d6b72c33d06b5496aed3627504eccb1630ecc1a202f6bd2dcf0272623` and canonical content set is
`725bbc872079c22df9fa2a1be35fa500e05eaafcb086deabb0aced70b1adf209`.

The sole fresh `/root/wp46_static_validator` found two successive high-severity run-binding gaps;
both were corrected with complete hash renewal, and the same validator returned final `PASS` with
no remaining critical, high, medium, or low finding and zero mutation. WP-46 is
`READY_FOR_OWNER_REVIEW`. It establishes no runtime, tenant-boundary, or architecture result, and
its exact twenty-path public inventory remains uncommitted and unpublished.

The owner accepted `WP46-REM-001` through `009`, `WP46-BIND-001` through `027`,
`WP46-DEC-001` through `007`, both finding resolutions, the renewed 67-file inventory, and the
independent static-validation `PASS`. Commit and push are authorized only for the frozen
twenty-path WP-46 public inventory. After verified publication, WP-47 may activate for exact
published rebinding and reauthorization-readiness owner-decision documentation only. All runtime,
product, architecture-selection, infrastructure, provider, network, and customer/live-data gates
remain closed.

## WP-72 publication and WP-73 static remediation — 2026-10-09

The exact frozen four-path WP-72 inventory was committed as
`9abe1c3 WP-72: close inconclusive recursive RLS execution` and published at
`9abe1c36fd307da136284969f7805067bd92ceda`. The published repository tree is
`fb29597108583f3cb4eea62ae8a82fc0c0d3f63d`. WP-72 is `VERIFIED_AND_CLOSED` as immutable
`INCONCLUSIVE_CLOSED_NO_RETRY` evidence and grants no retry or inherited execution authority.

WP-73 changes the disposable proof audit insert only from untyped `$12` to `$12::text` at the
polymorphic `jsonb_build_object` boundary, adds one dependency-free contract and mutation suite,
and updates the proof contract and governing documentation. The query remains parameterized with
the same twelve ordered values, and the audit detail remains exactly `reason` plus
`synthetic: true`.

Root static validation passed with exact Node `v22.23.1`: all 49 proof scripts passed syntax,
all 16 built-in-only suites passed, and the renewed inventory contains 82 files. Artifact-inventory
SHA-256 is `93d1e7975dc13d3f1bd5e5471473b3008dd99df56630447ce78779ecfa12a759`;
canonical no-terminal-LF content-set SHA-256 is
`89f63f1749ac20a453f0c45923e2d7de3b8a722541d9fb872650c7a2facae222`. Fresh independent validator
`/root/wp73_static_validator` reproduced the exact nine-path scope, all 82 entries and both
aggregate hashes, all 49 syntax checks, all 16 suites, the exact query contract, eleven protected
hashes, clean index and whitespace, secret absence, and every closed gate. It returned `PASS` with
zero findings and zero candidate mutation. Its ignored validation record has SHA-256
`ceca7aebce165c284a2c75f0516f41e23e318e113862e8275133d0bd82ba2001`.

Under standing completion authority, all nine remediation controls, all nineteen bindings,
`DEC-204`, all eight WP-73 decisions, the renewed inventory and hashes, and the exact frozen
nine-path public/proof inventory are accepted; commit and push are authorized only for that scope.
Static PASS is not a runtime, tenant-isolation, audit, architecture, dependency, implementation,
or production-security result. Dependencies, credentials/environments, preflight, images,
Docker/Compose,
containers, databases, services, SQL, cleanup, proof/reproduction, network, application coding,
final architecture selection, infrastructure, deployment, provider accounts/cost, and
customer/live data remain closed.

## WP-73 publication and WP-74 rebinding candidate — 2026-10-09

The exact frozen nine-path WP-73 public/proof inventory was committed as
`052b6b7 WP-73: accept audit parameter typing remediation` and published at
`052b6b7855bd726d5fe1de44db0067ba54eb23ff`. The published repository tree is
`fef38848093945a7a69bec8b882f1233493da139`; the proof tree is
`c2cbcb3f117653d2f42f0ee688dab5baf0055c8f`. The 82-file inventory and aggregate hashes remain
`93d1e7975dc13d3f1bd5e5471473b3008dd99df56630447ce78779ecfa12a759` and
`89f63f1749ac20a453f0c45923e2d7de3b8a722541d9fb872650c7a2facae222`. WP-73 is
`VERIFIED_AND_CLOSED`.

WP-74 binds that publication as one indivisible prospective candidate. It preserves all thirteen
stopped attempts, advances only a later clean dedicated checkout at the exact published revision
and the exact typed audit candidate, rejects shared or stopped workspaces, non-exact variants,
interpolation or security weakening, and static-PASS-as-runtime-evidence. It creates no identity,
private authorization draft, run, material, dependency state, or execution authority. Fresh
independent documentation validator `/root/wp74_doc_validator` reproduced the live publication,
82 entries and both hashes, every bound artifact hash, all 39 bindings, ten decisions, thirteen
stopped attempts, all option dispositions, exact four-path scope, clean index/whitespace, secret
absence, and every closed gate. It returned `PASS` with zero findings and zero mutation.

Under standing completion authority, all 39 bindings, ten decisions, workspace and audit-candidate
dispositions, `DEC-205`, and the exact four-path public inventory are accepted; commit and push are
authorized only for that inventory. Every dependency, material, runtime, network, product,
architecture, infrastructure, deployment, provider, and customer-data gate remains closed.

## WP-74 publication and WP-75 identity readiness — 2026-10-09

The exact four-path WP-74 inventory was committed as
`844f16e WP-74: accept audit remediation rebinding` and published at
`844f16e8afe7199c1704e91d7f5920af00cfc434`. The published governance repository tree is
`8acea824f3e4c0740f1d07f875704557f5c0cc00`; the accepted proof revision remains
`052b6b7855bd726d5fe1de44db0067ba54eb23ff`; and the proof tree remains
`c2cbcb3f117653d2f42f0ee688dab5baf0055c8f`. WP-74 is `VERIFIED_AND_CLOSED`.

WP-75 records `/root` only as proposed primary operator, creates exactly one fresh proposed
reproduction-validator identity `/root/wp75_reproduction_validator`, preserves
`/root/tp01_security_review` only as proposed bounded technical reviewer, and prepares exactly one
ignored private draft. The attestation is `PASS` with zero authority and zero operation. The draft
is `DRAFT_NOT_AUTHORIZED`; contains no package/run, checkout, dependency state, credential,
database URL, private environment, pull token, or runtime material; preserves all thirteen stopped
attempts; lists 19 proposal-only stages; and keeps all 32 action-authority flags false.

WP-75 may perform only identity/readiness documentation, ignored private draft preparation, and
static validation. It may not create an effective authorization or run, create a checkout, restore
or invoke dependencies, generate runtime materials, run preflight, inspect or retrieve images,
invoke Docker/Compose, start containers/databases/services, execute SQL, cleanup, proof, or
reproduction, use network access, change application code, select final architecture, create
infrastructure, deploy, incur provider cost, or access customer/live data. The exact four-path
candidate is frozen pending one fresh independent readiness validator.

Fresh independent readiness validator `/root/wp75_readiness_validator` returned `PASS` with no
findings and zero mutation. It reproduced the live publication and trees, all 82 proof entries and
both hashes, all 39 inherited and 41 readiness bindings, ten decisions, thirteen stopped attempts,
the exact role separation and attestation hash, the ineffective draft hash and structural counts,
null package/run/material state, exact four-path scope, secret absence, clean index/whitespace, and
every closed gate. Under standing completion authority, `DEC-206`, all bindings, decisions,
proposed roles, the attestation, ineffective draft, and exact four-path public inventory are
accepted; commit and push are authorized only for that inventory. WP-75 itself grants no material
or execution authority.

## WP-75 publication and WP-76 controlled execution result — 2026-10-09

The exact four-path WP-75 inventory was committed as
`b66e580 WP-75: accept audit parameter execution readiness` and published at
`b66e5806e67f101ee214dbba45940d2546d1864c`; repository tree is
`fc38a84737f6c574d489b51050ebd5e75ccdaaee`. WP-75 is `VERIFIED_AND_CLOSED`.

WP-76 run `wp76-2026-10-09-01` passed the exact 82-file binding, private-control and effective-
authorization validation, preflight, local accepted-image verification without registry access,
bounded PostgreSQL start, PRIMARY reachability/reset/security capture, matrix verification, and
one PRIMARY proof command. PRIMARY produced 222 unique result rows, 222 audit records, 222 exact
actual/expected matches, and unchanged tracked state. The earlier audit-parameter error did not
recur.

The required private handoff-seal command stopped before seal logic because Node `v22.23.1` does
not export named value `COPYFILE_EXCL` from `node:fs`. No handoff seal, verification, validator-
provenance attestation, or reproduction authority existed; reproduction correctly did not run.
The accepted deviation schema also cannot encode this private handoff-stage stop, which remains
preserved in a separate run-bound record and all three role reviews.

Mandatory cleanup, private-environment and dependency removal, residual verification, and
dedicated-checkout removal passed. Final verification failed closed on absent reproduction
reachability. The 20-entry role-review seal and final 23-entry inventory passed fresh independent
validation. Under standing completion authority, `DEC-207` through `DEC-209`, all four findings,
eight remediation controls, seven WP-76 decisions, exact four-path public inventory, and
`INCONCLUSIVE_CLOSED_NO_RETRY` are accepted. No TP-01 or architecture result is accepted.
Commit/push is authorized only after fresh public-packet validation. After verified publication,
only WP-77 handoff-seal interface and operational-stop consistency static remediation may start;
runtime, application, architecture, infrastructure, deployment, provider, network, and customer-
data gates remain closed.

## WP-76 publication and WP-77 static-remediation activation — 2026-10-09

The exact frozen four-path WP-76 public inventory was committed as
`db7a611 WP-76: close inconclusive audit parameter execution` and published at
`db7a6113ca5455cda0193efc6fa2e6ae3f76ad98`; the published repository tree is
`0805d0f655b8e23cfb6f4a2ebdea1ba21c3a8784`. Local `HEAD`, cached `origin/main`, and live remote
main matched. WP-76 is `VERIFIED_AND_CLOSED` without retry. Its PRIMARY observations remain
preliminary, and its private evidence remains immutable.

WP-77 was limited to proof/private-control static remediation of the private handoff tools'
exclusive-copy interface, dependency-free module-instantiation and no-overwrite coverage, typed
`PRIMARY_HANDOFF / SEAL_PRIMARY_HANDOFF_READ_ONLY` stop accounting, final-verifier consistency,
complete affected-hash and proof-inventory renewal, and exactly one fresh independent static
validator. The renewed 84-file proof inventory, all 51 syntax checks, all 17 dependency-free proof
suites, and the three-case private module/copy suite passed. Fresh independent validator
`/root/wp77_static_validator` returned `PASS` with zero findings. Under standing completion
authority, the exact frozen thirteen-path inventory is accepted and authorized for publication.

No dependency, credential/environment, preflight, image, Docker/Compose runtime, container,
database, service, SQL, cleanup execution, proof, handoff, reproduction, or network action is
authorized. Application coding, final architecture selection, infrastructure, deployment,
provider accounts/cost, and customer/live data remain closed. After verified WP-77 publication,
only WP-78 published rebinding and reauthorization-readiness documentation may activate.

## WP-77 publication and WP-78 documentation-only activation — 2026-10-09

The exact frozen thirteen-path WP-77 public/proof inventory was committed as
`6785d65 WP-77: remediate handoff seal and stop consistency` and published at
`6785d650fc3c9649bd364ae1edfc066141a97701`. The published repository tree is
`be2ccf5d2e1d494ab6d31ee3247da456ad0163c0`; the published proof tree is
`b5f144de1e948030e0c61aaeae90d36b79f0466a`. Local `HEAD`, cached `origin/main`, and live remote
main matched. WP-77 is `VERIFIED_AND_CLOSED` with no runtime result.

The published proof inventory contains 84 files. Artifact-inventory SHA-256 remains
`366724187427dfa9e4eb0e1ff0e2ad882e786077943e4d8324eaec0204d40a39`; canonical no-terminal-LF
content-set SHA-256 remains
`4763359c30e1914f2257b0da6bc7345c4b877fe47e3852354a1b2452bdcdd45d`. The accepted private
handoff-seal and handoff-verification tool SHA-256 values remain
`e394659ccf8968cdf927f3ba2e0388c97a219a43eb9a94df627b276ccb331b3b` and
`44b3feccbb05f873d6a8126a124f98dccdf36b39783c9055b387f37baa552410`. Fresh independent static
validator `/root/wp77_static_validator` returned `PASS` with zero findings; its private report
SHA-256 is `cd1f0f437ed4c825ac57168334997196cdcb52d015154c0067dc8f6c4d27ed7c`.

WP-78 was limited to owner-decision documentation that rebinds the exact published candidate,
fourteen immutable stopped attempts, renewed inventory and hashes, corrected private-tool hashes,
typed handoff-stop controls, independent static result, workspace choice, exact candidate choice,
and remaining reauthorization conditions. It may not create or assign an execution identity,
create a private authorization draft, restore or invoke dependencies, create credentials or
environments, run preflight, inspect or retrieve images, invoke Docker/Compose, create containers,
databases, or services, execute SQL, cleanup, proof, handoff, or reproduction, use network access,
change application code, select architecture, create infrastructure, deploy, incur provider cost,
or access customer/live data. Fresh independent validator `/root/wp78_documentation_validator`
returned `PASS` with zero findings and zero candidate mutation. Under standing completion
authority, the exact bindings, option dispositions, ten decisions, and frozen four-path inventory
are accepted and authorized for publication. No execution identity or private authorization draft
exists under WP-78.

The exact twenty-path WP-46 inventory was committed as
`bbcb4b2 WP-46: accept database connection remediation` and pushed to `origin/main`. Local `HEAD`,
cached `origin/main`, and live remote main matched
`bbcb4b266942f529322fbdc0f5e7f1270711dcc2`; the committed proof tree is
`8ecdb3c22b47f2e95cbf6007c6c90e6b2ae96b82`. WP-46 is `VERIFIED_AND_CLOSED`.

WP-47 binds that exact publication, proof tree, 67-file inventory, authorization-bound database
connection contract, independent static result, all seven immutable stopped attempts, workspace
choices, role readiness, and remaining execution gates for owner decision. It creates no private
authorization draft, role, subagent, run ID, credential, token, checkout, or dependency state.
Dependencies, preflight, images, Docker/Compose runtime, containers, databases, services, cleanup,
proof/reproduction, application coding, architecture selection, infrastructure, deployment,
provider accounts/cost, customer/live data, network, and WP-47 publication remain closed. WP-47 is
`READY_FOR_OWNER_DECISION` and `NOT_AUTHORIZED` for execution.

The owner accepted `TP1-DATABASE-REMEDIATED-BIND-001` through `044`, `WP47-DEC-001` through
`010`, advanced `WP47-WS-001` and `WP47-DBAUTH-001`, rejected both alternative sets, and accepted
the no-private-authorization-draft disposition. Commit and push are authorized only for the frozen
four-path WP-47 public inventory. After verified publication, WP-48 may activate for one fresh
reproduction-validator identity, owner-decision documentation, and private ineffective
authorization preparation only. All execution and product gates remain closed.

The exact four-path WP-47 inventory was committed as
`b86d868 WP-47: accept database connection rebinding` and pushed to `origin/main`. Local `HEAD`,
cached `origin/main`, and live remote main matched
`b86d868da52c8393d0e376b6f4eaf51c8298c89f`. WP-47 is `VERIFIED_AND_CLOSED`.

WP-48 created exactly one fresh identity, `/root/wp48_reproduction_validator`, which returned a
`PASS` independence and zero-authority attestation and performed no mutation. Its private draft is
explicitly ineffective: no execution package, run ID, checkout, credential, database URL,
credential/URL digest, token, or runtime authority exists; all 21 action-authority flags and both
effectiveness gates are false. WP-48 is `READY_FOR_OWNER_DECISION`; checkout, dependencies,
preflight, images, Docker/Compose, credentials, databases, services, cleanup, proof/reproduction,
application coding, architecture selection, infrastructure, deployment, provider accounts/cost,
customer/live data, network, and publication remain closed.

The owner accepted `WP48-DEC-001` through `010`, `TP1-EXEC-DATABASE-BIND-001` through `018`,
the proposed primary operator, fresh reproduction validator and attestation, proposed technical
security reviewer, and explicitly ineffective private draft on 2026-10-09. Commit and push are
authorized only for the frozen four-path WP-48 public inventory. After verified publication,
WP-49 may activate for the exact owner-authorized run `wp49-2026-10-08-01` at accepted proof
revision `bbcb4b266942f529322fbdc0f5e7f1270711dcc2`. Until then, every WP-49 execution gate
remains closed.

The exact frozen four-path WP-48 inventory was committed as
`a5b2221 WP-48: accept database authorization readiness` and pushed to `origin/main`. Local
`HEAD`, cached `origin/main`, and live remote main matched
`a5b222169f82bfe282b516d41a9a561c50796916`. WP-48 is `VERIFIED_AND_CLOSED`.

WP-49 activated for the exact owner-authorized run `wp49-2026-10-08-01` at proof revision
`bbcb4b266942f529322fbdc0f5e7f1270711dcc2`. Exact offline restoration reused 115 packages with
zero downloads, fresh credential and canonical database-URL digests were bound to an effective
private authorization, and local inspection confirmed the accepted image without a pull token or
registry access.

The run stopped before preflight completed because the private runtime-environment file did not
shell-quote the absolute evidence-directory value containing spaces. The authorization guard
received no usable evidence directory and failed closed before preflight Docker/Compose inspection.
No container, database, proof case, primary packet, reproduction, or interim verifier ran.

Mandatory cleanup, credential removal, residual verification, and disposable-checkout removal
passed. All three role reviews are `INCONCLUSIVE`; both independent reviewers reproduced every
sealed stop-packet hash. The final verifier failed closed on absent `environment.json`. WP-49 is
`INCONCLUSIVE_CLOSED_NO_RETRY`, establishes no tenant-boundary or architecture result, and is
`READY_FOR_OWNER_REVIEW`. WP-49 commit, push, and remediation remain closed.

The owner accepted the WP-49 Inconclusive disposition, both deviations, all three role reviews,
cleanup and residual verification, credential/dependency and checkout removal, fail-closed final
verification, 13-entry private inventory, `WP49-REM-001` through `007`, and `WP49-DEC-001`
through `007`. WP-49 is closed without retry. Commit and push are authorized only for the frozen
four-path public inventory. After verified publication, WP-50 may activate for the accepted
proof-only private-environment and preflight-launcher static remediation with exactly one fresh
independent static validator. All runtime, dependency, credential, product, architecture,
infrastructure, deployment, provider, network, and customer/live-data gates remain closed.

The frozen four-path WP-49 inventory was committed as
`f1f17f1 WP-49: accept Inconclusive database execution` and pushed to `origin/main`. Local `HEAD`,
cached `origin/main`, and live remote main matched
`f1f17f1bef03d74d46efa6f3acfb18a29a50249d`. WP-49 is `VERIFIED_AND_CLOSED`.

WP-50 is active for proof-only private-environment activation and preflight-launcher static
remediation. The candidate parser treats the private environment as non-evaluated literal data,
and the new launcher accepts only an absolute private file and the preflight operation. Built-in-
only tests cover paths containing spaces, inert credential metacharacters, strict key/context
rejection, explicit child-environment construction, minimized typed failure evidence, and a formal
stopped-preflight deviation. The renewed proof inventory contains 71 files. Independent static
validation returned `PASS` after resolving one medium canonical-digest finding and one low private-
wording finding. WP-50 is `READY_FOR_OWNER_REVIEW`, unpublished, and grants no execution authority.

The owner accepted `WP50-REM-001` through `008`, `WP50-BIND-001` through `024`, resolved
`WP50-VAL-001` and `002`, the renewed 71-file inventory, and the independent static-validation
`PASS`. Commit and push are authorized only for the frozen twelve-path WP-50 public/proof
inventory. After verified publication, WP-51 may activate for private-environment remediation
rebinding and reauthorization-readiness owner-decision documentation only. Every dependency,
credential, checkout, runtime, product, architecture, infrastructure, deployment, provider,
network, and customer/live-data gate remains closed.

The frozen eight-path WP-53 inventory was committed as
`09f5a62 WP-53: accept full-sequence environment continuity` and pushed to `origin/main`. Local
`HEAD`, cached `origin/main`, and live remote main matched
`09f5a620502b294a6bc5fa3ee2c8397bc6da3094`; the committed proof tree is
`356ed3d79707ba3b7c77db8c09f80cc26b2ffd54`. WP-53 is `VERIFIED_AND_CLOSED`.

WP-54 is active for owner-decision documentation only. It binds the exact WP-53 publication,
renewed inventory and operation contract, cleanup boundary, stopped-run history, workspace and
continuity choices, role readiness, and remaining authorization gates. It creates no proof change,
role, subagent, authorization draft, run, checkout, dependency/material state, runtime evidence,
application code, architecture decision, infrastructure, deployment, provider action, network
access, or customer/live-data action.

WP-54 records 46 exact candidate bindings, all eight immutable stopped attempts, dedicated-
workspace and full-sequence command-continuity choices, role readiness, ten owner recommendations,
and the no-private-authorization-draft disposition. Documentation validation passes with exactly
four public paths and no proof change. WP-54 is `READY_FOR_OWNER_DECISION`,
`NOT_READY_FOR_EXECUTION_AUTHORIZATION`, and `NOT_AUTHORIZED`.

The owner accepted `WP54-DEC-001` through `010` and
`TP1-FULL-SEQUENCE-REMEDIATED-BIND-001` through `046`; advanced `WP54-WS-001` and
`WP54-CONT-001`; rejected `WP54-WS-002/003` and `WP54-CONT-002/003`; and accepted the no-private-
authorization-draft disposition. Commit and push are authorized only for the frozen four-path
WP-54 public inventory. After verified publication, WP-55 may create exactly one fresh
reproduction-validator identity and prepare owner-decision documentation plus one explicitly
ineffective private authorization draft. Every checkout, dependency, credential/environment,
runtime, product, architecture, infrastructure, deployment, provider, network, and customer/live-
data gate remains closed.

The frozen four-path WP-54 inventory was committed as
`7604646 WP-54: accept full-sequence remediation rebinding` and pushed to `origin/main`. Local
`HEAD`, cached `origin/main`, and live remote main matched
`7604646942ba828883abfbc998b93dfbb19ca333`; the proof tree remained
`356ed3d79707ba3b7c77db8c09f80cc26b2ffd54`. WP-54 is `VERIFIED_AND_CLOSED`.

WP-55 created exactly one fresh identity, `/root/wp55_reproduction_validator`, which attested
independence, zero execution authority, and zero mutation. An explicitly ineffective private
draft has null execution package/run, checkout, credential, URL, environment path, secret-derived
digests, and token material; false effectiveness/retry gates; 24 false action-authority flags;
eight immutable stopped attempts; and 26 proposed stages only. WP-55 is
`READY_FOR_OWNER_DECISION` and does not authorize checkout, material preparation, preflight,
runtime work, or publication.

The owner accepted `WP55-DEC-001` through `010`,
`TP1-EXEC-FULL-SEQUENCE-BIND-001` through `024`, primary operator `/root`, fresh reproduction
validator `/root/wp55_reproduction_validator` and its independence attestation, technical reviewer
`/root/tp01_security_review`, and the explicitly ineffective private authorization draft. Commit
and push are authorized only for the frozen four-path WP-55 public inventory. After verified
publication, WP-56 may execute exactly one new controlled run `wp56-2026-10-09-01` at accepted
proof revision `09f5a620502b294a6bc5fa3ee2c8397bc6da3094` under the recorded workspace,
offline-dependency, material-binding, full-sequence launcher, local-first image, conditional pull,
reachability, cleanup, role, network, and non-scope controls. Product, architecture-selection,
infrastructure, deployment, provider-cost, and customer/live-data gates remain closed.

The frozen four-path WP-55 inventory was committed as
`62c4296 WP-55: accept full-sequence execution readiness` and pushed to `origin/main`. Local
`HEAD`, cached `origin/main`, and live remote main matched
`62c4296de4dd03298e39aba0942005ecff703dc7`; repository tree is
`5d9edff3cf77234060de481e390bf377f4bec905` and the accepted proof tree remains
`356ed3d79707ba3b7c77db8c09f80cc26b2ffd54`. WP-55 is `VERIFIED_AND_CLOSED`.

WP-56 then activated exactly once as run `wp56-2026-10-09-01` in a clean dedicated checkout at
the accepted proof revision. Exact offline restoration reused 115 packages with zero downloads
and no lifecycle scripts. Preflight, local accepted-image verification, and PostgreSQL start
passed without registry or other internet access. The first mandatory reachability gate stopped
fail-closed: the private launcher correctly withheld `TP01_BOOTSTRAP_PASSWORD`, while the
reachability command's `docker compose ps` invocation still required that variable for Compose
configuration interpolation. No database reset, proof case, primary result, sealed primary
handoff, or reproduction occurred.

Mandatory cleanup, credential removal, residual verification, and dedicated-checkout removal
passed. All three role reviews are `INCONCLUSIVE`; both independent reviewers reproduced all 15
sealed hashes. Final verification failed closed on absent success reachability evidence. The
private packet contains 18 inventoried entries, no secret values, and no runtime residue. WP-56
is non-retryable, establishes no tenant-boundary or architecture result, and was accepted for
publication of its exact frozen four-path inventory. At owner acceptance, WP-57 remained closed
until that publication was verified.

The frozen four-path WP-56 inventory was committed as
`dca083c WP-56: accept Inconclusive full-sequence execution` and pushed to `origin/main`. Local
`HEAD`, cached `origin/main`, and live remote main matched
`dca083c1a531ae05961e0822089ce0c674ad770e`; repository tree is
`bd539ddd07827f9f2754c964723719092d3ecef8`. WP-56 is `VERIFIED_AND_CLOSED` without retry.

WP-57 is active for proof-only static remediation. It may make the read-only Compose publisher
inspection independent of the real bootstrap credential, add exact non-secret interpolation
evidence, extend formal operational-stop accounting to primary and reproduction reachability
failures, add dependency-free tests, renew affected hashes, and use exactly one fresh independent
static validator after freeze. Dependencies, credentials/environments, preflight, images,
Docker/Compose runtime, containers, databases, services, cleanup execution, proof/reproduction,
application coding, architecture selection, infrastructure, deployment, provider accounts/cost,
customer/live data, network, and WP-57 publication remain closed.

WP-57 static remediation is complete and the sole fresh independent validator returned `PASS`
with no findings. The renewed governed proof inventory contains 72 files. The owner accepted all
eight remediation controls, all 27 bindings, resolved `WP57-VAL-001`, all six decisions, the
renewed inventory, independent `PASS`, and exact frozen fourteen-path public/proof package, and
authorized its commit and push. Dependencies, credentials/environments, runtime,
proof/reproduction, network, product work, architecture selection, infrastructure, deployment,
provider operations, and customer/live data remain closed.

The exact frozen fourteen-path WP-57 inventory was committed as
`753e853 WP-57: accept reachability stop remediation` and pushed to `origin/main`. Local `HEAD`,
cached `origin/main`, and live remote main matched
`753e853725147c00f4c76d5288e6a3f002a4b7b3`; repository tree is
`904738477644c969e1727203f2c003d66bf9e586` and proof tree is
`53e22adde7a169ff66cabf33afb493eb5031443a`. WP-57 is `VERIFIED_AND_CLOSED`.

WP-58 is active for owner-decision documentation that binds the exact published WP-57 revision,
renewed 72-file proof inventory, interpolation and operational-stop contract, immutable stopped-run
history, workspace/reachability choices, and remaining later authorization gates. WP-58 may create
no execution role, reproduction-validator identity, private authorization draft, checkout,
dependency state, credential/environment, token, runtime evidence, or execution authority. All
material, runtime, product, architecture,
infrastructure, deployment, provider, customer/live-data, and network gates remain closed.

WP-58 documentation validation completed with independent binding, governance, and scope `PASS`
results after resolving `WP58-VAL-001` and `WP58-VAL-002`. The owner accepted all 61 candidate
bindings, all nine immutable stopped attempts, the dedicated-workspace and exact reachability
choices, all ten decisions, the no-private-draft disposition, and the exact frozen four-path public
inventory. Commit and push are authorized only for that inventory; every execution and material
gate remains closed.

The exact frozen four-path WP-58 inventory was committed as
`78cf459 WP-58: accept reachability remediation rebinding` and pushed to `origin/main`. Local
`HEAD`, cached `origin/main`, and live remote main matched
`78cf459e970a6b4bd64f8cc7e553d3e0beaaabcd`; repository tree is
`b5a9efcc97543cf0d01638d0586ca80a4b19d225` and the accepted proof tree remains
`53e22adde7a169ff66cabf33afb493eb5031443a`. WP-58 is `VERIFIED_AND_CLOSED`.

WP-59 is active only for exactly one fresh reproduction-validator identity, owner-decision
documentation, and one explicitly ineffective private authorization draft. It may not create a
run, effective authorization, checkout, run-bound dependency state, credential/environment, token,
preflight, image/runtime action, cleanup execution, proof/reproduction, product work, architecture
selection, infrastructure, deployment, provider action, customer/live-data access, or network
authority.

WP-59 validation completed with independent binding, draft, and scope/governance `PASS` results
after resolving `WP59-VAL-001`. Under the owner's standing completion authorization, all 30 exact
bindings, the proposed role identities, the fresh-validator attestation, the explicitly
ineffective private draft, all ten decisions, and the frozen four-path public inventory are
accepted. Commit and push are authorized only for that inventory. Checkpoint 2 remains closed;
any later WP-60 controlled execution requires a new exact run identity and effective private
authorization under the accepted fail-closed controls.

The exact frozen four-path WP-59 inventory was committed as
`e84ac24 WP-59: accept reachability execution readiness` and pushed to `origin/main`. Local
`HEAD`, cached `origin/main`, and live remote main matched
`e84ac2410fa00155f34133284ec96263d90233f8`; repository tree is
`578a14a0a5dfd017c6215a14a7721af44687e8a6` and proof tree remains
`53e22adde7a169ff66cabf33afb493eb5031443a`. WP-59 is `VERIFIED_AND_CLOSED`.

WP-60 ran once as `wp60-2026-10-09-01`. Exact preparation, preflight, local-image verification,
database start, and PRIMARY reachability passed. The first database reset stopped fail-closed
because its minimized environment lacked a non-secret Compose-only interpolation value. No SQL,
fixture, proof case, primary handoff, or reproduction ran. Mandatory cleanup, credential and
dependency removal, residual verification, checkout removal, and all three Inconclusive reviews
passed; final verification failed closed. The owner standing completion authorization accepts the
19-entry private packet, `WP60-DEV-001` through `003`, `WP60-REM-001` through `008`, all seven
decisions, closure without retry, and publication of only the frozen four-path WP-60 inventory.

The exact frozen four-path WP-60 inventory was committed as
`d7b3987 WP-60: accept Inconclusive reachability-stop execution` and pushed to `origin/main`.
Local `HEAD`, cached `origin/main`, and live remote main matched
`d7b398709aa6cd0eb4f586f3cc38424fea339306`; repository tree is
`057728fe332e29cd75d97ff9c60231c328019506` and the accepted proof tree remains
`53e22adde7a169ff66cabf33afb493eb5031443a`. WP-60 is `VERIFIED_AND_CLOSED` without retry.

WP-61 is active only for proof-only static remediation. It may give `db:reset` one fresh
non-secret Compose-configuration interpolation value while keeping the real bootstrap credential
excluded; add native phase-specific `DB_RESET` stop evidence and bounded diagnostics; add
dependency-free tests; renew the complete proof inventory; and obtain exactly one fresh
independent static validation after freeze. Dependencies, credentials/environments, preflight,
images, Docker/Compose runtime, containers, databases, services, SQL, fixtures, cleanup execution,
proof/reproduction, evidence execution, network, application coding, architecture selection,
infrastructure, deployment, provider accounts/cost, and customer/live data remain closed.

WP-61 primary and sole fresh independent static validation passed with no severity findings. The
owner's standing completion authorization accepted all eight controls, all 16 bindings, all six
decisions, the renewed 74-file inventory, and the exact frozen 11-path inventory. It was committed
as `67b4733 WP-61: accept reset interpolation remediation` and pushed to `origin/main`. Local
`HEAD`, cached `origin/main`, and live remote main matched
`67b4733584fde8f3ecaf2f9f7c15ef883c9b127b`; repository tree is
`d6d29df9388e9d283e1b01d7bf568ba022f257e8` and proof tree is
`c86c7331a362f6da50471bb4fbfa3dd9bd70f236`. WP-61 is `VERIFIED_AND_CLOSED`.

WP-62 records 53 exact candidate bindings, all ten immutable stopped attempts, the accepted
dedicated-workspace and exact reset-remediation choices, role and no-draft boundaries, and ten
accepted owner decisions. Primary and independent read-only validation passed after resolving
`WP62-VAL-001`, an interim `DEC-193` status mismatch. Under standing completion authorization,
the exact four-path public inventory is accepted and publication is authorized. WP-62 creates no
execution identity, authorization draft, material, runtime evidence, or execution permission.

The exact frozen four-path WP-62 inventory was committed as
`faee541 WP-62: accept database reset remediation rebinding` and pushed to `origin/main`. Local
`HEAD`, cached `origin/main`, and live remote main matched
`faee541ce30175b54310309d6830878cbb606583`; repository tree is
`01c1f3c77b5ceb162b2c8844abb7089f640f8ace` and proof tree remains
`c86c7331a362f6da50471bb4fbfa3dd9bd70f236`. WP-62 is `VERIFIED_AND_CLOSED`.

WP-63 created exactly one fresh `/root/wp63_reproduction_validator`, recorded its independent
zero-authority/zero-operation attestation, and prepared one explicitly ineffective private draft.
The draft has no execution package/run or material identities; effectiveness, checkpoint, retry,
and all 30 action flags are false. Primary and independent readiness validation passed for all 32
bindings, 74 inventory entries, ten immutable attempts, exact roles, 18 proposal-only future
stages, and the four-path scope. Under standing completion authorization, all ten decisions and
the exact frozen four-path public inventory are accepted; publication is authorized. No
execution, material, runtime, network, product, architecture, infrastructure, deployment,
provider, or customer/live-data authority is opened.

The exact frozen four-path WP-63 inventory was committed as
`5175a8d WP-63: accept database reset execution readiness` and pushed to `origin/main`. Local
`HEAD`, cached `origin/main`, and live remote main matched
`5175a8d6091498316f8f54dcca7c0be6784eb488`; repository tree is
`a921bfb22c427aa8a00dff09c311e77f98b2a8ae` and proof tree remains
`c86c7331a362f6da50471bb4fbfa3dd9bd70f236`. WP-63 is `VERIFIED_AND_CLOSED`.

WP-64 ran once as `wp64-2026-10-09-01`. It passed exact preparation,
offline/frozen/ignore-scripts restoration, preflight, local-image verification without registry
access, bounded database start, PRIMARY three-view reachability, and all four ordered reset SQL
files. It stopped fail-closed when nested database evidence capture invoked Docker Compose outside
the accepted synthetic reset-interpolation environment. Fixture and database-security evidence did
not complete; matrix verification, all proof cases, primary handoff, and reproduction did not run.

The native PRIMARY `DB_RESET` operational stop recorded possible partial mutation conservatively.
Mandatory cleanup removed the container, network, volume, dependencies, generated output, private
runtime environment, and disposable checkout. Residual verification passed. All three role reviews
are `INCONCLUSIVE`, both independent reviewers matched all 12 sealed entries, and the final
verifier failed closed on absent `fixture.json`. The final private inventory contains 18 entries
plus its inventory; aggregate SHA-256 is
`0fc7b7734850b5c7b615eba45ddb82c6dc139aadadb7fb7c0ab32959af6fb5cc` and inventory SHA-256 is
`f1696ad6e212b8aa4b047d3ea292dcc33e4f3cab2da17f60ba7dd4bfc52d5f3d`.

Under standing completion authorization, WP-64 is accepted as
`INCONCLUSIVE_CLOSED_NO_RETRY`; its exact four-path public inventory is authorized for commit and
push. After verified publication, WP-65 may change only the disposable TP-01 proof, governing
documentation, and ignored private static evidence needed to cover every Docker Compose call
reachable from reset-time evidence capture with the same fresh non-secret, non-retained
interpolation boundary; preserve lifecycle, secret-exclusion, diagnostic, partial-mutation, and
operational-stop controls; add dependency-free tests; renew all affected hashes; and obtain exactly
one fresh independent static validator. Dependencies, credentials/environments, preflight, images,
Docker/Compose runtime, containers, databases, SQL, fixtures, cleanup execution, proof/reproduction,
network, application coding, architecture selection, infrastructure, deployment, provider
accounts/cost, and customer/live data remain closed.

## WP-69 publication and WP-70 rebinding candidate — 2026-10-09

The exact ten-path WP-69 public/proof inventory was committed as
`b89c540 WP-69: accept recursive RLS static remediation` and published at
`b89c54023f539a45608b8fc2057faec5db0a0103`. The repository tree is
`3651dcdd91e189a29aad25df83615db3051c54d4`; proof tree is
`7542b7459c0296dbbc6cf74636b0efb97201968a`. WP-69 is `VERIFIED_AND_CLOSED`.

WP-70 binds that exact publication, the 80-file inventory and aggregate hashes, the acyclic forced-
RLS candidate, all twelve immutable stopped attempts, clean-dedicated-checkout choice, exact-
candidate choice, role/no-draft state, and later execution gates. It advances only the exact
published candidate for later identity and ineffective-draft readiness. It rejects shared or
stopped workspaces, every non-exact candidate, RLS/role/grant weakening, application-side
substitution, and any claim that static PASS proves runtime PostgreSQL or tenant-isolation behavior.

WP-70 creates no role, validator identity, authorization draft, run, checkout, dependency state,
credential, environment, token, or runtime evidence. Fresh independent documentation validator
`/root/wp70_doc_validator` returned `PASS` with no findings after reproducing the exact four-path
scope, all published identities, 80 proof files, 43 bindings, ten decisions, twelve stopped
attempts, and every closed gate. Under standing completion authority, WP-70 is accepted and
commit/push are authorized only for that exact inventory. Dependencies, preflight, images,
Docker/Compose, databases, SQL, cleanup, proof/reproduction, network, application coding, final
architecture selection, infrastructure, deployment, provider accounts/cost, and customer/live
data remain closed.

## WP-84 publication and WP-85 planning activation — 2026-10-09

The exact four-path WP-84 inventory was published at
`c7a4bd57a8d94dd60014d2b0f1217ab5008ad2eb`, with repository tree
`91791ebd8ea0812a869a1e80a81a1b1e747582a5`; local `HEAD`, cached `origin/main`, and live remote
main matched. The proof tree remained `45369309793a803e761ace440c291c7d1ebdfe37`. WP-84 is
`VERIFIED_AND_CLOSED` without retry.

WP-85 is active only for owner-decision documentation and static/private planning of a separate
Docker host-access readiness gate. It may define exact future checks, evidence, expiry, roles,
stop behavior, and authority separation, and it may create one ignored explicitly ineffective
private planning draft. It may not contact the Docker API, inspect or retrieve an image, create a
pull token, invoke Compose, start or remove a container/network/volume, access a database or
service, restore dependencies, generate credentials, create an effective authorization, execute
preflight/proof/reproduction/cleanup, use network, change application code, select architecture,
create infrastructure, deploy, incur provider cost, or access customer/live data.

The owner accepted `WP85-OPT-001`, rejected `WP85-OPT-002` through `004`, and accepted `DEC-220`,
`WP85-BIND-001` through `022`, `WP85-DEC-001` through `008`, the ineffective private draft, and
root static-validation `PASS` exactly as recorded. Commit and push are authorized only for the
exact four-path WP-85 public inventory. After verified publication, WP-86 may prepare owner-
decision documentation and one private ineffective authorization draft only. Docker/API execution
and every runtime, proof, network, product, architecture, infrastructure, deployment,
provider/cost, and customer/live-data gate remain closed.

## WP-85 publication and WP-86 authorization-readiness activation — 2026-10-09

The exact four-path WP-85 inventory was published at
`b5d3e3a6e1ad68101017a92f22ed95d9f745093d`, with repository tree
`f04c446c754c4ddfa88519553980f4e71928d609`; local `HEAD`, cached `origin/main`, and live remote
main matched. The proof tree remained `45369309793a803e761ace440c291c7d1ebdfe37`. WP-85 is
`VERIFIED_AND_CLOSED` without any Docker or proof execution.

WP-86 is active only for owner-decision documentation and private ineffective authorization
preparation for a future read-only Docker host-access probe. It may bind the exact publication,
future command shape, minimized receipt, expiry, proposed roles, and closed authority flags. It may
not instantiate a validator, create executable controls or an effective authorization, contact the
Docker API, inspect or retrieve images, invoke Compose, operate runtime resources, restore
dependencies, generate credentials, run preflight/proof/reproduction/cleanup, use network, change
application code, select architecture, create infrastructure, deploy, incur provider cost, or
access customer/live data.

The owner accepted `DEC-221`, `WP86-BIND-001` through `022`, `WP86-DEC-001` through `010`,
`/root` only as proposed probe operator, `/root/wp86_docker_access_validator` only as the reserved
proposed fresh validator, the ineffective private draft, and static-validation `PASS`. Commit and
push are authorized only for the exact four-path WP-86 inventory. After verified publication,
WP-87 may materialize documentation/private static controls and instantiate exactly that one fresh
validator for zero-authority attestation. Docker/API execution, context inspection, version
handshake, and every runtime, proof, network, product, architecture, infrastructure, deployment,
provider/cost, and customer/live-data gate remain closed.

## WP-86 publication and WP-87 static-materialization activation — 2026-10-09

The exact four-path WP-86 inventory was published at
`211cf95249afc7e75263bbe9ca41aae905888964`, with repository tree
`249949d8480da21bafd3516e2dec8989b24d1e61`; local `HEAD`, cached `origin/main`, and live remote
main matched. The proof tree remained `45369309793a803e761ace440c291c7d1ebdfe37`. WP-86 is
`VERIFIED_AND_CLOSED` without Docker/API execution, context inspection, or version handshake.

WP-87 is active only for documentation and ignored private static materialization. It may create
the exact import-safe probe contract, controller, receipt verifier, dependency-free tests, one
ineffective authorization draft, and exactly one fresh zero-authority validator attestation. It
may not contact Docker, inspect a context, perform a version handshake, create operational
evidence, restore dependencies, create credentials, execute preflight/proof/reproduction/cleanup,
use network, change application code, select architecture, create infrastructure, deploy, incur
provider cost, or access customer/live data.

Exactly one fresh independent validator was instantiated as
`/root/wp86_docker_access_validator`. Static validation with exact Node.js `v22.23.1` passed all
five syntax checks and all six dependency-free tests without invoking Docker or creating runtime
evidence. The owner accepted `DEC-222`, `WP87-BIND-001` through `028`, `WP87-DEC-001` through
`008`, resolution of `WP87-VAL-001` through `003`, the exact private artifact hashes, attestation,
ineffective draft, and independent static-validation `PASS`. Commit and push are authorized only
for the exact four-path WP-87 public inventory. After verified publication, WP-88 may prepare
owner-decision documentation and one private ineffective run-specific authorization candidate;
actual Docker/API probe execution and every other closed gate remain closed.

## WP-87 publication and WP-88 authorization-readiness activation — 2026-10-09

The exact four-path WP-87 public inventory was published at
`e5f19a3ebe9d6657f8af0a5a63e74ef2b2681489`, with repository tree
`502b629c155ca15fbbe01b240c41675b66f2462f`; local `HEAD`, cached `origin/main`, and live remote
main matched. The proof tree remained `45369309793a803e761ace440c291c7d1ebdfe37`. WP-87 is
`VERIFIED_AND_CLOSED` with static controls only and no Docker/API execution.

WP-88 is active only for owner-decision documentation and one ignored, explicitly ineffective,
run-specific authorization candidate for a possible later WP-89 probe. It may bind the accepted
publication, exact control hashes, proposed roles, proposed package/probe IDs, command/evidence
contract, and closed authority flags. It may not discover or bind an operator process UID or
Docker executable, create an effective authorization, assign execution timestamps/evidence paths,
contact Docker, inspect a context, perform a version handshake, create a receipt/stop, use network,
or perform any runtime, proof, product, architecture, infrastructure, deployment, provider/cost,
or customer/live-data action.

The owner accepted `DEC-223`, `WP88-BIND-001` through `032`, `WP88-DEC-001` through `010`, the
proposed WP-89 package and probe identities, proposed roles, exact control hashes, ineffective
private draft, and root static-validation `PASS`. Commit and push are authorized only for the
exact four-path WP-88 public inventory. After verified publication, exactly one controlled WP-89
probe may create fresh effective private authorization and perform only the accepted two local
Docker operations, ending after one receipt or typed stop. Every other gate remains closed.

## WP-88 publication and WP-89 controlled probe — 2026-10-09

The exact four-path WP-88 public inventory was published at
`5cba0a4489edab6d149e882ee9f48c912e7a0ea3`, with repository tree
`4936db70020b0e5de256ae509d772f4dea2a51ba`; local `HEAD`, cached `origin/main`, and live remote
main matched. The proof tree remained `45369309793a803e761ace440c291c7d1ebdfe37`. WP-88 is
`VERIFIED_AND_CLOSED`.

The separately authorized WP-89 probe `wp89-2026-10-09-01` created one fresh 12-minute effective
private authorization, bound the current operator process UID and Docker executable bytes, and
performed exactly the accepted local `desktop-linux` context inspection and client/server version
handshake. It returned one minimized `READY` receipt with client and server version `29.7.2` and no
typed stop. The independent validator returned `PASS` without contacting Docker or network.

The receipt is single-use, consumed by validation, non-reusable, and incapable of authorizing
TP-01, an image, runtime, proof, architecture, or product action. No image, registry, Compose,
container, network, volume, database, service, dependency, credential, preflight, proof,
reproduction, application, infrastructure, deployment, provider/cost, or customer/live-data action
occurred. The owner accepted `DEC-224`, `WP89-BIND-001` through `030`, `WP89-DEC-001` through
`008`, the exact five-entry private packet, both validation passes, absence of stop/retry, and the
no-cleanup disposition. Commit and push are authorized only for the exact four-path WP-89 public
inventory. After verified publication, WP-90 may prepare owner-decision documentation and one
private ineffective TP-01 reauthorization candidate only. Every execution and product gate
remains closed.

## WP-89 publication and WP-90 reauthorization-readiness activation — 2026-10-10

The exact four-path WP-89 public inventory was published at
`f4cc84e1065a9bfd42d605022a85caf7b1d30cdf`, with repository tree
`6048487a0b4e548613e01d9c2ddda9792b4784a1`; local `HEAD`, cached `origin/main`, and live remote
main matched. The proof tree remained `45369309793a803e761ace440c291c7d1ebdfe37`. WP-89 is
`VERIFIED_AND_CLOSED`; its consumed host-readiness receipt is historical evidence only.

WP-90 is active only for owner-decision documentation and one ignored, explicitly ineffective
TP-01 reauthorization draft. It may bind the published revision, unchanged 86-file proof identity,
closed-attempt history, workspace/proof/host-access options, proposed later stages, and all-false
authority flags. It may not create a run or validator identity, checkout, dependency state,
credential, environment, run-bound control, effective authorization, preflight, Docker/image/
runtime state, proof/reproduction evidence, application code, architecture decision,
infrastructure, deployment, provider cost, network action, or customer/live-data access.

The owner accepted `DEC-225`, `WP90-BIND-001` through `040`, `WP90-DEC-001` through `010`, the
recorded option dispositions, ineffective private draft, and root static-validation `PASS`.
Commit and push are authorized only for the exact four-path WP-90 public inventory. After verified
publication, WP-91 may instantiate exactly one fresh reproduction-validator identity and prepare
owner-decision documentation plus one private ineffective authorization draft only. Every
materialization, execution, product, and operational gate remains closed.

## WP-90 publication and WP-91 identity-readiness candidate — 2026-10-10

The exact four-path WP-90 public inventory was published at
`15947077215509d5ee13a710af3cf44d787f5f57`, with repository tree
`86be4083aaf6f3906bf62be0a66d8e744e465959`; local `HEAD`, cached `origin/main`, and live remote
main matched. The proof tree remained `45369309793a803e761ace440c291c7d1ebdfe37`. WP-90 is
`VERIFIED_AND_CLOSED`.

WP-91 instantiated exactly one fresh proposed reproduction-validator identity,
`/root/wp91_reproduction_validator`, with a zero-authority independence attestation. `/root` and
`/root/tp01_security_review` remain proposed identities only. The ignored private draft is
`DRAFT_NOT_AUTHORIZED`; no package/run exists, all 38 authority flags are false, exactly 28
identity/material/result values are null, and all 18 stages are proposal-only.

WP-91 prepared only owner-decision documentation, ignored private authorization-readiness
records, and static validation. It may not create a checkout, dependency state, credential,
environment, run-bound control, effective authorization, preflight, image/Docker state, runtime,
proof/reproduction evidence, application code, architecture decision, infrastructure, deployment,
provider cost, network action, or customer/live-data access.

The owner accepted `DEC-226`, `TP1-EXEC-HOST-BIND-001` through `044`, `WP91-DEC-001` through
`010`, the proposed role identities, independence attestation, ineffective private draft, and root
static-validation `PASS`. Commit and push are authorized only for the exact four-path WP-91 public
inventory. WP-92 execution remains closed pending a separate authorization bound to the verified
WP-91 publication revision.

## WP-91 publication and WP-92 controlled result candidate — 2026-10-10

The exact four-path WP-91 public inventory was published at
`246bf8ce446379b47a4c1e48b4666e2fb35c7763`, with repository tree
`8e7ec406f665fd0c899ccf957807159e13ec412b`; local `HEAD`, cached `origin/main`, and live remote
main matched. The proof tree remained `45369309793a803e761ace440c291c7d1ebdfe37`. WP-91 is
`VERIFIED_AND_CLOSED`.

The owner separately authorized WP-92 run `wp92-2026-10-10-01`. Preparation, exact offline
dependency restoration, fresh private material, effective-authorization validation, current
preflight, local-image verification, bounded PostgreSQL start, PRIMARY reachability and reset,
the 222-case PRIMARY proof, and immutable handoff verification passed. PRIMARY produced 222
expected-matching results, 222 matching audit records, and unchanged state, but those observations
remain preliminary.

The independent reproduction validator then stopped fail-closed during its mandatory reachability
gate because that exact execution context could not access the local Docker socket. Reproduction
reset and proof did not run. Mandatory cleanup and final residual verification passed; no registry
request occurred and no proof runtime, credential, dependency state, provider cost, or customer
data remains. The authorization-bound finalization controls cannot truthfully classify this
post-PRIMARY stop, so they were not invoked and final verification remains fail-closed.

The owner accepted WP-92 as `INCONCLUSIVE_CLOSED_NO_RETRY`, `DEC-227`, all three deviations, all
six remediation controls, all seven package decisions, the three role reviews, mandatory cleanup
and final residual result, fail-closed verifier disposition, 21-entry stop seal, 32-entry private
inventory, archived checkout, and independent final-packet `PASS`. Commit and push are authorized
only for the exact four-path WP-92 public inventory. After verified publication, WP-93 may begin
only proof/private-control static remediation of reproduction-context reachability, immutable
handoff/deviation custody, and truthful post-PRIMARY finalization. Application coding,
architecture selection, infrastructure, deployment, provider accounts/cost, runtime, network,
and customer/live data remain closed.

## WP-92 publication and WP-93 static remediation candidate — 2026-10-10

The owner-accepted four-path WP-92 public inventory was committed and published at
`078e1aa2b097237e8b667ef087f4ea1b036309ad`; local `HEAD`, cached `origin/main`, and the live remote
matched. Repository tree was `2494d9d52c67e16879f6e6507d1a8981b1e246db`, and the unchanged
proof tree was `45369309793a803e761ace440c291c7d1ebdfe37`. WP-92 is verified and closed
`INCONCLUSIVE_CLOSED_NO_RETRY`.

WP-93 is active only for static remediation of independent-validator context readiness, immutable
PRIMARY handoff/deviation custody, append-only post-handoff stop accounting, and truthful
post-PRIMARY finalization. The candidate introduces no application code and performs no dependency,
credential, preflight, image, Docker/Compose, database, cleanup, proof, reproduction, network, or
external-system action. Its prospective controls and renewed inventory require owner acceptance
before any commit or push. All execution and architecture-selection gates remain closed.

The owner accepted `DEC-228`, `WP93-REM-001` through `008`, `WP93-BIND-001` through `021`,
`WP93-DEC-001` through `007`, the renewed 90-file inventory and hashes, resolution of all three
independent findings, and the final independent static-validation `PASS`. Commit and push are
authorized only for the exact eighteen-path WP-93 public/proof inventory. After verified
publication, WP-94 may begin owner-decision documentation only. Private authorization preparation,
execution, and all other closed gates remain unchanged.

## WP-93 publication and WP-94 readiness candidate — 2026-10-10

The exact eighteen-path WP-93 public/proof inventory was published at
`25c0e5eaad8d6e0e54b93cb833ac424c73090287`, with repository tree
`1d70cc4a3728171f27c42fc8ec38b3bc6ec3bfc0` and proof tree
`1e9f75fdc1b221009bc691f54d24ca63f02c8038`. Local `HEAD`, cached `origin/main`, and live remote
main matched. WP-93 is `VERIFIED_AND_CLOSED` without proof execution.

WP-94 rebinds only the accepted 90-file proof candidate and its static controls to that verified
publication for owner decision. It may document exact workspace, proof, validator-context,
handoff-custody, finalization, stopped-history, and successor-readiness options. It may not create
an authorization draft, execution identity, run, checkout, dependency state, credential,
environment, preflight, image/Docker state, runtime resource, proof/reproduction evidence, or any
application, architecture, infrastructure, deployment, provider/cost, network, or customer-data
change. WP-94 commit and push require later owner acceptance.

The owner accepted `DEC-229`, `WP94-BIND-001` through `037`, `WP94-DEC-001` through `010`, all
twelve option dispositions, the resolved Low metadata finding, and the final independent
documentation-validation `PASS`. Commit and push are authorized only for the exact four-path
WP-94 public inventory. After verified publication, WP-95 may begin owner-decision documentation,
instantiate exactly one fresh reproduction-validator subagent identity and zero-authority
attestation, and prepare one explicitly ineffective private authorization draft. WP-95 may not
create a checkout, dependency state, credential/environment, effective authorization, preflight,
image/Docker state, runtime resource, proof/reproduction evidence, application code, architecture
selection, infrastructure, deployment, provider/cost action, network action, or customer/live-data
access, and its commit/push gate remains closed.

## WP-94 publication and WP-95 readiness candidate — 2026-10-10

The exact four-path WP-94 public inventory was published at
`e4dafa09c102d6e728fea8894f94afbf8c54394e`, with repository tree
`3e45685ec71831414e9e4543259bf0ab2478e137` and unchanged proof tree
`1e9f75fdc1b221009bc691f54d24ca63f02c8038`. Local `HEAD`, cached `origin/main`, and live remote
main matched. WP-94 is `VERIFIED_AND_CLOSED` without proof execution.

WP-95 records `/root` only as proposed primary operator, creates exactly one fresh proposed
reproduction-validator identity `/root/wp95_reproduction_validator` and zero-authority attestation,
preserves `/root/tp01_security_review` only as proposed technical security reviewer, and prepares
one ignored, explicitly ineffective private authorization draft. It creates no execution package,
run, checkout, dependency state, credential/environment, run-bound control, effective
authorization, preflight, image/Docker state, runtime resource, proof/reproduction evidence,
application code, architecture selection, infrastructure, deployment, provider/cost action,
network action, external-system mutation, or customer/live-data access. WP-95 commit and push
require later owner acceptance.

The owner accepted `DEC-230`, `TP1-EXEC-CONTEXT-BIND-001` through `052`, `WP95-DEC-001` through
`010`, `/root` only as proposed primary operator, `/root/wp95_reproduction_validator` as the sole
fresh proposed reproduction validator and its zero-authority attestation,
`/root/tp01_security_review` only as proposed technical security reviewer, the explicitly
ineffective private draft, and root static-validation `PASS`. Commit and push are authorized only
for the exact four-path WP-95 public inventory. After verified publication, work must stop and
report the exact publication revision required for a separate WP-96 controlled-execution
authorization. Every execution and product/operations gate remains closed.

## WP-70 publication and WP-71 identity readiness — 2026-10-09

The exact four-path WP-70 inventory was committed as
`620906d WP-70: accept recursive RLS rebinding` and published at
`620906d1aaf8a20306aa1782963958ba3f05f985`. Repository tree is
`7a359a4aba2d5d02ca8dccb63ad6052f94fdc0d3`; the accepted proof revision remains
`b89c54023f539a45608b8fc2057faec5db0a0103` and proof tree remains
`7542b7459c0296dbbc6cf74636b0efb97201968a`. WP-70 is `VERIFIED_AND_CLOSED`.

WP-71 records `/root` only as proposed primary operator, creates exactly one fresh proposed
reproduction-validator identity `/root/wp71_reproduction_validator`, preserves
`/root/tp01_security_review` only as proposed bounded technical reviewer, and prepares exactly one
ignored private draft. The attestation is `PASS` with zero authority and zero operation. The draft
is `DRAFT_NOT_AUTHORIZED`; contains no package/run, checkout, dependency state, credential,
database URL, private environment, pull token, or runtime material; preserves all twelve stopped
attempts; lists 19 proposal-only stages; and keeps all 32 action-authority flags false.

WP-71 may perform only identity/readiness documentation, ignored private draft preparation, and
static validation. It may not create an effective authorization or run, create a checkout, restore
or invoke dependencies, generate runtime materials, run preflight, inspect or retrieve images,
invoke Docker/Compose, start containers/databases/services, execute SQL, cleanup, proof, or
reproduction, use network access, change application code, select final architecture, create
infrastructure, deploy, incur provider cost, or access customer/live data.

Root validation and fresh independent readiness validator `/root/wp71_readiness_validator`
returned `PASS` with no findings. They reproduced the live WP-70 publication, exact repository and
proof trees, all 80 proof entries and both aggregate hashes, the published WP-70 document and
private validation hashes, the exact four-path public scope, the ignored draft and attestation,
all 36 bindings, all ten decisions, twelve immutable attempts, 32 false authority flags, 19
proposal-only stages, and every closed gate. Under standing completion authority, WP-71 is
accepted and commit/push are authorized only for the exact frozen four-path inventory. A later
WP-72 package is the only possible next controlled-execution gate; WP-71 itself authorizes no
runtime action.

## WP-71 publication and WP-72 controlled execution result — 2026-10-09

The exact four-path WP-71 inventory was committed as
`ee7a13e WP-71: accept recursive RLS execution identity readiness` and published at
`ee7a13e577a460010159d3de58a9bef628ceb1dd`. The published repository tree is
`ebd321bfb4569173448c0cb8bcc09edebfd8e0fe`; the accepted proof revision remains
`b89c54023f539a45608b8fc2057faec5db0a0103`; and the proof tree remains
`7542b7459c0296dbbc6cf74636b0efb97201968a`. WP-71 is `VERIFIED_AND_CLOSED`.

WP-72 run `wp72-2026-10-09-01` passed exact checkout and 80-file binding, one offline frozen
dependency restoration with 115 packages reused and zero downloaded, effective private
authorization, preflight, local-only accepted-image verification, PostgreSQL start, PRIMARY
three-view reachability, database reset, database-security capture, and 222-case manifest
verification. The manifest inventory test passed, but all 222 executable cases stopped at the
common audit insert with PostgreSQL `42P18`, `could not determine data type of parameter $12`.
No executable oracle completed, so tenant isolation, zero leakage, audit behavior, combined
authorization enforcement, and the recursive-RLS remediation remain unmeasured. No PostgreSQL
`54001` was observed, but that diagnostic fact is not a proof result.

PRIMARY state remained unchanged. No complete PRIMARY packet or sealed handoff existed, so
reproduction correctly did not run. Mandatory cleanup, private-environment and dependency
removal, dedicated-checkout removal, and independent residual verification passed. The final
verifier failed closed because the required complete PRIMARY-and-reproduction reachability
sequence was absent. The three role reviews recommend `INCONCLUSIVE_CLOSED_NO_RETRY`.

The immutable role-review seal contains 17 entries and has SHA-256
`64d35104365089edd91c5d3a8fb777cb153609404af403c3ff60af85d997f87e`. The final private inventory
contains 21 entries, aggregate SHA-256
`de8b086d44c105c256b2544090ccaaa59c99f98a85817511bbcac852f78e7a27`, and inventory-file SHA-256
`f8a8203bc343bb58ac5fb8718988d7cdc90328255a7fe53dc97de6cfabb852d1`. Fresh independent validator
`/root/wp72_final_packet_validator` reproduced the complete packet and returned `PASS` with no
findings; its ignored validation record has SHA-256
`8cc8c20c22561640dfb6f3fbb7a2280cf01c953f570e127ba562b1b3562841cf`.

Under standing completion authority, WP-72 is accepted as `INCONCLUSIVE_CLOSED_NO_RETRY`; all
three deviations, seven remediation controls, seven decisions, three role reviews, cleanup and
residual results, fail-closed verifier outcome, exact private inventories, and frozen four-path
public inventory are accepted. No TP-01 or architecture result is accepted. Commit and push are
authorized only for the exact four public paths. After verified publication, WP-73 may perform
only bounded proof-only static remediation of the audit-detail parameter typing contract, add
dependency-free static regression coverage, renew every affected hash and the complete inventory,
and obtain exactly one fresh independent static validator. All dependency, material, runtime,
network, product, architecture, infrastructure, deployment, provider, and customer-data gates
remain closed.

WP-65 now provides an explicit database-evidence Compose environment for all seven reset calls and
both before/after state snapshots in each PRIMARY or REPRODUCTION proof invocation. Reset and proof
invocations generate distinct fresh strong non-secret values; every raw `TP01_*` value and ambient
`PGPASSWORD` is stripped. Runtime database-security capture uses only a temporary `PGPASSWORD`
clone, cleared on success or failure. Exact existing-service `compose exec -T` command shapes,
ordered reset/post-SQL progress, minimized diagnostics, snapshot-specific formal stops, and final
zero-stop enforcement are preserved.

Primary exact-Node syntax validation and all 14 dependency-free suites passed. The renewed proof
inventory contains 78 files; artifact-inventory SHA-256 is
`43cc0ce26b5d73b8ea96f86d0b6dc38ba81ea380922fb92405b0016e02a2776e` and canonical
no-terminal-LF content-set SHA-256 is
`d38ed487b01614c480e1a6c50022b502ed8e5c642b042aa53beb7bf551ccac70`. The sole fresh
`/root/wp65_static_validator` reproduced the exact 18-path scope, all 78 entries and both hashes,
all 45 syntax checks, all 14 built-in-only suites, every control/binding, and all unchanged
exclusions. It returned `PASS` with no severity findings and zero persistent mutation. Under
standing completion authorization, all nine controls, all 24 bindings, all six decisions, and the
exact frozen 18-path inventory are accepted; commit and push are authorized. Every material,
runtime, product, architecture, infrastructure, deployment, provider, network, and customer-data
gate remains closed until the separately bounded next package.

WP-51 is active for owner-decision documentation only. It binds the exact WP-50 publication,
renewed proof inventory, private-environment contract, stopped-run history, workspace and future
environment choices, role readiness, and remaining authorization gates. It creates no role,
subagent, private authorization draft, run, checkout, credential, dependency state, runtime
evidence, application code, architecture decision, infrastructure, deployment, provider action,
network access, or customer/live-data action.

WP-51 records 42 exact candidate bindings, all eight immutable stopped attempts, dedicated-
workspace and new raw-literal private-environment choices, role readiness, ten owner
recommendations, and the no-private-authorization-draft disposition. Static documentation
validation passed with exactly four public paths and no proof change. WP-51 is
`READY_FOR_OWNER_DECISION`, `NOT_READY_FOR_EXECUTION_AUTHORIZATION`, and `NOT_AUTHORIZED`.

The owner accepted `WP51-DEC-001` through `010` and
`TP1-PRIVATE-ENV-REMEDIATED-BIND-001` through `042`; advanced `WP51-WS-001` and
`WP51-ENV-001`; rejected the four alternatives; and accepted the no-private-draft disposition.
Commit and push are authorized only for the frozen four-path WP-51 public inventory. After
verified publication, WP-52 may create exactly one fresh reproduction-validator identity and
prepare owner-decision documentation plus one explicitly ineffective private authorization draft.
Every checkout, dependency, credential/environment-generation, runtime, product, architecture,
infrastructure, deployment, provider, network, and customer/live-data gate remains closed.

The frozen four-path WP-51 inventory was committed as
`90fa132 WP-51: accept private environment rebinding` and pushed to `origin/main`. Local `HEAD`,
cached `origin/main`, and live remote main matched
`90fa1326ac3f82462a24a78ebb4ea07d981342fa`; the proof tree remains
`52cf1ab1f936614551285ebf6c85462042daba89`. WP-51 is `VERIFIED_AND_CLOSED`.

WP-52 created exactly one fresh identity, `/root/wp52_reproduction_validator`, which attested
independence, zero execution authority, and zero mutation. An explicitly ineffective private
draft has null package/run, checkout, credential, URL, environment path, secret-derived digests,
and token material; false effectiveness/retry gates; 22 false action-authority flags; eight
immutable stopped attempts; and 26 proposed stages only. WP-52 is `READY_FOR_OWNER_DECISION` and
does not authorize checkout, material preparation, preflight, or runtime work. A
blocking readiness finding remains: the accepted private-environment launcher supplies values to
preflight only, while no accepted non-evaluating interface supplies the same environment to later
image, Compose, reset, proof, reproduction, and verification commands. A controlled run must not
be authorized until a proof-only static remediation closes that continuity gap.

The owner accepted `WP52-DEC-001` through `010`,
`TP1-EXEC-PRIVATE-ENV-BIND-001` through `021`, `WP52-FIND-001`, the exact proposed roles, the
fresh-validator attestation, and the explicitly ineffective private authorization draft. Commit
and push are authorized only for the frozen four-path WP-52 public inventory. After verified
publication, WP-53 may activate for proof-only static full-sequence private-environment command
continuity remediation, renewed hashes, dependency-free tests, and exactly one fresh independent
static validator. Dependencies, credential/environment generation, preflight, images,
Docker/Compose runtime, containers, databases, services, cleanup execution, proof/reproduction,
application coding, architecture selection, infrastructure, deployment, provider accounts/cost,
customer/live data, and network access remain closed.

The frozen four-path WP-52 inventory was committed as
`236ae6c WP-52: accept private environment authorization readiness` and pushed to `origin/main`.
Local `HEAD`, cached `origin/main`, and live remote main matched
`236ae6cf7eb88b72aded88031c103a5be3617509`; the proof tree remained
`52cf1ab1f936614551285ebf6c85462042daba89`. WP-52 is `VERIFIED_AND_CLOSED`.

WP-53 is active for proof-only static remediation of `WP52-FIND-001`. It may extend the exact
non-evaluating launcher across the fixed post-preflight command set, preserve direct exact-Node
cleanup semantics and dependency independence, add built-in-only tests, renew affected hashes,
and use exactly one fresh independent static validator after freeze. It may not operate
dependencies, credentials, environments, preflight, images, Docker/Compose, containers,
databases, services, cleanup, proof/reproduction, network, product code, architecture selection,
infrastructure, deployment, provider resources, or customer/live data, and it may not publish
without later owner acceptance.

WP-53 now defines eleven exact launcher operations spanning preflight through final verification,
with exact child mappings, operation-specific private-value minimization, unchanged exact-pnpm
restrictions, and direct exact-Node cleanup/final-verifier children. The renewed inventory remains
71 proof files. Exactly one fresh `/root/wp53_static_validator` independently reproduced the
eight-path scope, every file and aggregate hash, exact Node syntax, and the built-in-only launcher
suite and returned `PASS` with no critical, high, medium, or low finding. WP-53 is
`READY_FOR_OWNER_REVIEW`; commit and push remain unauthorized.

The owner accepted `WP53-REM-001` through `008`, `WP53-BIND-001` through `023`,
`WP53-DEC-001` through `006`, the renewed 71-file inventory, and the independent static-validation
`PASS`. Commit and push are authorized only for the frozen eight-path WP-53 public/proof inventory.
After verified publication, WP-54 may activate for full-sequence-remediated rebinding and
reauthorization-readiness owner-decision documentation only. Every dependency, credential,
environment, runtime, proof, product, architecture, infrastructure, deployment, provider,
network, and customer/live-data gate remains closed.

## WP-30 acceptance, publication, and WP-31 activation — 2026-10-07

The owner accepted the complete WP-30 Inconclusive stop packet, `WP30-DEV-001` through `003`, all
three role reviews, mandatory cleanup and residual verification, fail-closed final verification,
the 19-entry private evidence inventory, `WP30-REM-001` through `006`, and `WP30-DEC-001` through
`007`. WP-30 was closed without retry.

The frozen four-path public inventory was committed as
`138ff4a WP-30: record controlled remediated execution` and pushed to `origin/main`. Local `HEAD`,
cached `origin/main`, and live remote main matched
`138ff4ae8548d9ee61707a1c714a352e6af9d320`.

WP-31 is active for bounded proof-only static remediation. It may retain sanitized and bounded
failed-child stdout/stderr, align final-verifier Compose checks with the accepted normalization
contract, add dependency-free static tests, renew proof hashes, and use exactly one fresh
independent static validator after freeze. Dependencies, preflight, images, containers, databases,
services, cleanup execution, proof/reproduction, application coding, architecture selection,
infrastructure, deployment, provider accounts/cost, customer/live data, and WP-31 publication
remain closed.

WP-31 now retains redacted and bounded diagnostics for both proof compilation and test-child
failures, with explicit phase attribution and no argument-value retention. Final verification uses
the same raw/normalized Compose evidence contract as preflight. Exact syntax and dependency-free
tests passed; the renewed inventory contains 55 files. The single fresh independent validator
found three static gaps across its review passes; all were corrected with complete hash renewal,
and the same validator returned `PASS` with no unresolved finding and zero mutation. WP-31 is
`READY_FOR_OWNER_REVIEW` and establishes no runtime, tenant-boundary, or architecture result.

## WP-31 acceptance, publication, and WP-32 activation — 2026-10-07

The owner accepted `WP31-REM-001` through `007`, `WP31-BIND-001` through `021`,
`WP31-DEC-001` through `006`, the renewed 55-file inventory, and the independent static-validation
`PASS`. The frozen eleven-path inventory was committed as
`f1705e9 WP-31: accept diagnostic verifier remediation` and pushed to `origin/main`.

Local `HEAD`, cached `origin/main`, and live remote main matched
`f1705e93ec6e3e1433e7ec1aba5fd803bb312b2c`; the committed proof tree is
`d360f992f0e082e80dded4de790efe3511546c77`. WP-31 is `VERIFIED_AND_CLOSED`.

WP-32 is active for owner-decision documentation and explicitly ineffective private authorization
preparation only. It may bind the exact published revision/tree/hashes, preserve stopped-run
history, analyze future workspace/role/dependency readiness, and prepare a draft that cannot satisfy
the execution guard. Dependencies, preflight, images, containers, databases, services, cleanup,
proof/reproduction, application coding, final architecture selection, infrastructure, deployment,
provider accounts/cost, customer/live data, and WP-32 publication remain closed.

## WP-32 acceptance, publication, and WP-33 result — 2026-10-07

The owner accepted `WP32-DEC-001` through `010`, `TP1-DIAGNOSTIC-BIND-001` through `027`,
advanced `WP32-WS-001`, rejected `WP32-WS-002/003`, and accepted the ineffective private draft.
The frozen four-path inventory was committed as
`e34093c WP-32: accept TP-01 diagnostic rebinding` and pushed to `origin/main`. Local `HEAD`,
cached `origin/main`, and live remote main matched
`e34093c32648199a20cc5a43d4b711f35ef6fd1c`. WP-32 is `VERIFIED_AND_CLOSED`.

WP-33 then activated for run `wp33-2026-10-07-01` at execution revision
`f1705e93ec6e3e1433e7ec1aba5fd803bb312b2c`. The dedicated checkout, fresh validator attestation,
exact offline restoration, effective authorization, and preflight passed. The accepted image
digest was already local, but the frozen image-verification script unconditionally executes
`docker pull`, conflicting with the owner's conditional-only registry authority. The operator
stopped before the script; no registry access, image evidence, database, fixture, proof, sealed
handoff, or reproduction occurred.

Mandatory cleanup and direct residual verification passed. All three reviews are `INCONCLUSIVE`;
final verification failed closed on missing `image.json`. WP-33 establishes no tenant-boundary or
architecture result, is non-retryable, and is `READY_FOR_OWNER_REVIEW`.

## WP-33 acceptance, publication, and WP-34 activation — 2026-10-07

The owner accepted the WP-33 Inconclusive disposition, `WP33-DEV-001`, all three role reviews,
mandatory cleanup and residual verification, the fail-closed final verifier, the 16-entry private
inventory, `WP33-REM-001` through `007`, and `WP33-DEC-001` through `007`. WP-33 is closed without
retry. Its frozen four-path public inventory was committed as
`56d3a1f WP-33: record controlled diagnostic execution` and pushed to `origin/main`.

Local `HEAD`, cached `origin/main`, and live remote main matched
`56d3a1f5c59080ab87fa82cdc4a67d418983b75c`. WP-33 is `VERIFIED_AND_CLOSED`.

WP-34 is active for proof-only static remediation of conditional image verification and the
registry gate. It may split local inspection from optional retrieval, require an explicit
run-bound pull token only when the digest is absent, record source/network/digest/platform
evidence, add dependency-free static tests, renew affected hashes, and use exactly one fresh
independent static validator after freeze. Dependencies, preflight, image or Docker operations,
containers, databases, services, cleanup execution, proof/reproduction, application coding,
architecture selection, infrastructure, deployment, provider accounts/cost, customer/live data,
and WP-34 publication remain closed.

## WP-34 acceptance, publication, and WP-35 activation — 2026-10-07

The owner accepted `WP34-REM-001` through `008`, `WP34-BIND-001` through `015`,
`WP34-DEC-001` through `006`, the renewed 57-file proof inventory, and the fresh independent
static-validation `PASS`. The exact fourteen-path WP-34 public inventory was committed as
`7fd5f57 WP-34: accept conditional image gate remediation` and pushed to `origin/main`.

Local `HEAD`, cached `origin/main`, and live remote main matched
`7fd5f57a2c121dbaa35995501e019a8609a6b0a3`; the committed proof tree is
`a0e146ec6cf5759b08346d8f6ac9bc1dfeee215b`. WP-34 is `VERIFIED_AND_CLOSED`.

WP-35 is active for owner-decision documentation and private ineffective authorization
preparation only. It may bind the published revision/tree/hashes, preserve stopped-run history,
analyze future workspace/dependency/role/image-token readiness, and prepare a draft that cannot
satisfy the execution guard. Role creation, checkout creation, dependencies, preflight, images,
containers, databases, services, cleanup, proof/reproduction, application coding, final
architecture selection, infrastructure, deployment, provider accounts/cost, customer/live data,
and WP-35 publication remain closed.

## WP-35 acceptance, publication, and WP-36 activation — 2026-10-07

The owner accepted `WP35-DEC-001` through `010`,
`TP1-IMAGE-REMEDIATED-BIND-001` through `032`, advanced `WP35-WS-001` and
`WP35-IMG-001`, rejected `WP35-WS-002/003` and `WP35-IMG-002/003`, and accepted the ineffective
private draft. The exact four-path public inventory was committed as
`9719c73 WP-35: accept conditional image rebinding` and pushed to `origin/main`.

Local `HEAD`, cached `origin/main`, and live remote main matched
`9719c73208be5870ef1f4a0f03d6c4d7d79435f6`. WP-35 is `VERIFIED_AND_CLOSED`.

WP-36 is active for owner-decision documentation, one fresh reproduction-validator identity and
attestation, and ineffective private authorization preparation only. Checkout creation,
dependencies, preflight, images, Docker/Compose, pull-token creation, containers, databases,
services, cleanup, proof/reproduction, application coding, final architecture selection,
infrastructure, deployment, provider accounts/cost, customer/live data, and WP-36 publication
remain closed.

## WP-36 acceptance, publication, and WP-37 result — 2026-10-07

The owner accepted `WP36-DEC-001` through `010`, `TP1-EXEC-IMAGE-BIND-001` through `009`,
primary operator `/root`, fresh reproduction validator `/root/wp36_reproduction_validator` and its
attestation, technical security reviewer `/root/tp01_security_review`, and the ineffective private
authorization draft. The exact four-path WP-36 inventory was committed as
`91b65c4 WP-36: accept execution identity readiness` and pushed to `origin/main`.

Local `HEAD`, cached `origin/main`, and live remote main matched
`91b65c4ee5307416792aae2da2182775c054df5a`. WP-36 is `VERIFIED_AND_CLOSED`.

WP-37 then activated for run `wp37-2026-10-07-01` at execution revision
`7fd5f57a2c121dbaa35995501e019a8609a6b0a3`. The dedicated checkout, exact offline dependency
restoration, effective private authorization, preflight, local-first image inspection, image
verification, database start/reset, security capture, fixture creation, and 222-case manifest
verification passed. The accepted image was already local, so no pull token was created and no
registry or other internet access occurred.

The database container was healthy internally, but Docker did not publish the required
`127.0.0.1:55432` host binding: publisher evidence reported target `5432` with published port `0`,
the host listener remained closed, and all 222 executable primary cases failed with
`ECONNREFUSED`. No valid primary result packet or sealed handoff existed, so reproduction correctly
did not run. Mandatory cleanup and direct residual verification passed; all three role reviews are
`INCONCLUSIVE`; the final verifier failed closed on the blocking deviation. WP-37 establishes no
tenant-boundary or architecture result, is non-retryable, and is `READY_FOR_OWNER_REVIEW`.

## WP-65 publication and WP-66 acceptance — 2026-10-09

The exact frozen 18-path WP-65 public/proof inventory was committed as
`b628f3e WP-65: accept database evidence continuity remediation` and published at
`b628f3e77d4b296f1c357b7a290ee84b3dbb72bd`. The published repository tree is
`beb4630c3b1020c9537b9356f54b88670d23ad41`; the proof tree is
`3696a8883d6f3d7eddead1460fc26b0af004d236`. The proof inventory contains 78 files;
artifact-inventory SHA-256 is
`43cc0ce26b5d73b8ea96f86d0b6dc38ba81ea380922fb92405b0016e02a2776e`; canonical
no-terminal-LF content-set SHA-256 is
`d38ed487b01614c480e1a6c50022b502ed8e5c642b042aa53beb7bf551ccac70`. WP-65 is
`VERIFIED_AND_CLOSED`.

WP-66 binds that publication as one indivisible documentation-only candidate. It preserves all
eleven immutable stopped attempts—WP-24, WP-27, WP-30, WP-33, WP-37, WP-41, WP-45, WP-49, WP-56,
WP-60, and WP-64—and advances only the clean dedicated-workspace option and the exact WP-65
invocation-scoped database-evidence continuity contract. Current/shared or stopped workspaces,
real-secret interpolation, partial/raw environment propagation, weakened stop accounting, and
static-PASS-as-runtime-evidence alternatives are rejected.

Under standing completion authority, `DEC-197`,
`TP1-DATABASE-EVIDENCE-CONTINUITY-BIND-001` through `040`, `WP66-DEC-001` through `010`, both
option-family dispositions, the no-private-draft/no-role disposition, and the exact four-path
public inventory are accepted; publication is authorized only for that inventory. WP-66 creates
no role, reproduction-validator identity, private authorization draft, checkout, dependency state,
credential/environment, runtime evidence, proof result, or execution permission.

Only after verified WP-66 publication may WP-67 create exactly one fresh reproduction-validator
identity and prepare owner-decision documentation plus one explicitly ineffective private
authorization draft. WP-67 remains a later readiness package only; it may not create a run,
effective authorization, checkout, dependency state, material, preflight, image/runtime action,
cleanup execution, proof/reproduction, network authority, product work, architecture selection,
infrastructure, deployment, provider action, or customer/live-data access.

## WP-66 publication and WP-67 activation — 2026-10-09

The exact frozen four-path WP-66 public inventory was committed as
`f49e173 WP-66: accept database evidence continuity rebinding` and published at
`f49e173d7b190cd9fb9b6a0c9829dfaf99a898c5`. The published repository tree is
`0572a54631f1444300a541de39468868c1a23734`; the accepted proof revision remains
`b628f3e77d4b296f1c357b7a290ee84b3dbb72bd`; and the proof tree remains
`3696a8883d6f3d7eddead1460fc26b0af004d236`. The proof inventory contains 78 files;
artifact-inventory SHA-256 is
`43cc0ce26b5d73b8ea96f86d0b6dc38ba81ea380922fb92405b0016e02a2776e`; canonical
no-terminal-LF content-set SHA-256 is
`d38ed487b01614c480e1a6c50022b502ed8e5c642b042aa53beb7bf551ccac70`. WP-66 is
`VERIFIED_AND_CLOSED`.

WP-67 may record `/root` as proposed primary operator, create exactly one fresh proposed
reproduction-validator identity `/root/wp67_reproduction_validator` and its separate
zero-authority independence attestation, preserve `/root/tp01_security_review` as proposed bounded
technical reviewer, prepare owner-decision documentation, and prepare exactly one ignored private
draft that is explicitly `DRAFT_NOT_AUTHORIZED`, ineffective, checkpoint-closed, and
non-retryable. The draft contains no package/run, checkout, dependency, credential, database URL,
environment, token, or interpolation material and grants no action authority.

The fresh identity attestation and independent readiness validation passed with zero mutation and
no findings. Under standing completion authority, `DEC-198`, all 34 exact bindings,
`WP67-DEC-001` through `010`, the proposed later roles, the explicitly ineffective private draft,
and the exact four-path public inventory are accepted; publication is authorized only for that
inventory. Checkout creation, dependencies, materials, preflight, images, Docker/Compose runtime,
containers, databases, services, SQL, fixtures, cleanup execution, proof/reproduction, evidence
verification, network, application coding, architecture selection, infrastructure, deployment,
provider accounts/cost, and customer/live data remain closed. Only a later separately accepted
WP-68 package could authorize one exact new controlled run and create a new effective private
authorization.

## WP-67 publication and WP-68 result — 2026-10-09

The exact frozen four-path WP-67 public inventory was committed as
`ab35ce9 WP-67: accept database evidence execution readiness` and published at
`ab35ce9e9522f7b66c7929679072c24a8c92dd98`. The published repository tree is
`85c06a268c2594cdee7ceae078bf2b699c52da1e`; the accepted proof revision remains
`b628f3e77d4b296f1c357b7a290ee84b3dbb72bd`; and the proof tree remains
`3696a8883d6f3d7eddead1460fc26b0af004d236`. WP-67 is `VERIFIED_AND_CLOSED`.

WP-68 then executed the single authorized synthetic run `wp68-2026-10-09-01`. Exact offline,
frozen, ignore-scripts dependency restoration; preflight; local accepted-image inspection with no
registry access; PostgreSQL start; PRIMARY three-view reachability; ordered reset; fixture and
database-security evidence; and the frozen 222-case matrix check all passed. The PRIMARY proof
stopped fail-closed when all 222 executable cases returned PostgreSQL `54001` (`stack depth limit
exceeded`). PRIMARY state hashes were unchanged, but no case oracle passed, no complete primary
packet or handoff existed, and reproduction correctly did not run.

Mandatory authorization-independent cleanup passed. The private runtime environment, generated
dependencies, runtime resources, and dedicated checkout were removed; independent residual
verification passed. All three role reviews are `INCONCLUSIVE`, and final verification failed
closed on the incomplete primary-and-reproduction sequence. A provisional 17-entry seal mismatch
was preserved and explicitly renewed without runtime or proof re-execution; both independent roles
verified the final 18-entry seal at SHA-256
`0c3337922eb8eaeed3f52f2be5fc5c208bccceb2eb034504804e124d83a6a6ed`. The final private
inventory contains 21 entries, aggregate SHA-256
`8e96485e97abdd104d66ae7f9f5d65d4c85df5882aec589aabf7f6dc35954a7b`, and inventory-file
SHA-256 `0920bec66d2b0fe14e32e3515eb154c9e4b60614095fb9532f3c25288517ccb7`.

Under standing completion authority, WP-68 is `INCONCLUSIVE_CLOSED_NO_RETRY`. It establishes no
tenant-isolation, zero-leakage, architecture, or implementation result. The bounded next candidate
is WP-69 proof-only static remediation of the recursive authorization/state path, with renewed
hashes and one fresh independent static validator. Runtime, application coding, final architecture
selection, infrastructure, deployment, provider accounts/cost, network, and customer/live data
remain closed. Final independent validation of the exact four-path public packet returned `PASS`
with no findings. The packet was published at

`9e3741ef0bcfca426cefb3b299d29105e78fdbb8`; WP-68 is `VERIFIED_AND_CLOSED` without retry.

## WP-69 recursive authorization/state-path static remediation — 2026-10-09

Static analysis traced the exact WP-68 failure to a forced-RLS cycle:
`platform.organizations` policy → `can_discover_organization` → `can_access_tenant` → the same
organization policy. WP-69 separates membership/support/machine authority from organization
lifecycle lookup, adds an identity-preserving organization-row visibility function, and removes
the recursive function edge while keeping all six protected tables under enabled and forced RLS.
The runtime role remains non-owner, non-superuser, and `NOBYPASSRLS`; the owner remains non-login.

The final evidence verifier now distinguishes four exact security-definer authority functions from
the security-invoker row-visibility function. A new dependency-free graph contract proves the
effective policy/function graph acyclic and rejects cycle, RLS weakening, owner-login, or frozen
semantic drift. Exact Node `v22.23.1` syntax checks passed for all 47 proof scripts, and all 15
built-in-only test suites passed. The renewed proof inventory contains 80 files; artifact-inventory
SHA-256 is `8cb9082083a4611f0fe2e3e3d61c0306a47ca62b4292e738a4f0c73f64a686e6`, and canonical
content-set SHA-256 is `aefb6865d7ffb89d906bb7d369b99e9300cb0f1f09581b0a99b8cd7889882f4c`.

The sole fresh independent static validator, `/root/wp69_static_validator`, returned `PASS` with no
findings after reproducing the exact ten-path scope, all 80 file hashes and both aggregate
identities, 47 syntax checks, 15 suites, and every security and closure control. Under standing
completion authority, WP-69 is accepted and commit/push are authorized only for that exact
inventory. Static PASS is not a tenant-isolation proof or execution authorization. Dependencies,
credentials, runtime, Docker/Compose, databases, services, cleanup, proof/reproduction, network,
application coding, final architecture selection, infrastructure, deployment, provider
accounts/cost, and customer/live data remain closed.

## WP-78 publication and WP-79 identity readiness — 2026-10-09

The exact four-path WP-78 inventory was published at
`b6f645058fcb46b0eda78cee0b5e8d1c4f944c13`, with repository tree
`c8ea0604f18fca61746b7c324ae0595749915b8e`; the accepted proof remains revision
`6785d650fc3c9649bd364ae1edfc066141a97701`, repository tree
`be2ccf5d2e1d494ab6d31ee3247da456ad0163c0`, and proof tree
`b5f144de1e948030e0c61aaeae90d36b79f0466a`. WP-78 is `VERIFIED_AND_CLOSED`.

WP-79 records `/root` only as proposed primary operator, creates the sole fresh proposed
reproduction identity `/root/wp79_reproduction_validator` and its zero-authority attestation,
preserves `/root/tp01_security_review` only as proposed bounded technical reviewer, and prepares
one ignored explicitly ineffective draft. The WP-77 private handoff tools are reviewed templates,
not executable future controls, because their bytes retain consumed WP-76 bindings. New run-bound
handoff paths and hashes remain null. All material, execution, network, product, architecture,
infrastructure, deployment, provider/cost, and customer/live-data gates remain closed pending
fresh independent readiness validation and exact publication.

## WP-80 controlled primary-handoff execution result — 2026-10-09

The exact four-path WP-79 inventory was published at
`90200b29e2bc5bfe69c420129dcca071066dddfc`, with repository tree
`4a11387c2e29d5fa62039267e1b0a296faa50365`. WP-80 then consumed two distinct run IDs.
Run `wp80-2026-10-09-01` stopped before preflight because its effective authorization omitted the
preparation-controller binding; cleanup and residual absence passed, and the run is
`PREAUTH_INVALID_CLOSED_NO_EXECUTION_NO_RETRY`.

Run `wp80-2026-10-09-02` passed preparation, exact offline dependency restoration, preflight,
local-image verification, PostgreSQL start, PRIMARY reachability/reset/security capture, the
222-case matrix, and one PRIMARY proof. PRIMARY contained 222/222 expected-matching results, 222
matching audit records, and unchanged state. The mandatory handoff seal then stopped fail-closed
because its semantic contract applied the ordinary per-case cleanup marker to the first valid
pool-reuse case `TP1-C199`. No seal, preserved copies, provenance attestation, or reproduction was
created. Mandatory cleanup, material removal, residual verification, three role reviews, and the
final fail-closed verifier completed.

WP-80 is `INCONCLUSIVE_CLOSED_NO_RETRY`. Fresh independent private-packet validation returned
`PASS` for the exact 20-entry stop seal, 24-entry inventory, stop and absence controls, preliminary
PRIMARY observations, cleanup, residual result, closed checkout, no registry access, synthetic-
only data, and unchanged tracked proof. Under standing completion authority, `DEC-213` through
`DEC-215`, `WP80-DEV-001` through `005`, `WP80-REM-001` through `008`, and `WP80-DEC-001`
through `007` are accepted. Publication is limited to the exact four paths in document 83.

After verified publication, WP-81 may perform only proof/private-control static remediation of
group-aware result-context semantics, PRIMARY/REPRODUCTION comparison, minimized semantic-failure
evidence, dependency-free tests, affected hashes/inventory, and one fresh independent static
validation. Dependencies, credentials, runtime, Docker/Compose, databases, cleanup execution,
proof/reproduction, network, application coding, architecture selection, infrastructure,
deployment, provider accounts/cost, and customer/live data remain closed.

## WP-80 publication and WP-81 static candidate — 2026-10-09

The exact four-path WP-80 inventory passed fresh public-packet validation and was published at
`93295af37df943c4f7810ef245c41294ffaea2fc`, with repository tree
`ef13e09ebd4a09cff05e70c08d2518658bad8a38`; the proof tree remained
`b5f144de1e948030e0c61aaeae90d36b79f0466a`. WP-80 is `VERIFIED_AND_CLOSED` without retry.

WP-81 preserves the proof emitter and manifest and corrects only later semantic controls. A new
dependency-free contract distinguishes ordinary per-case rollback from `TP1-CASE-008` pool-reuse
context reset, validates exact context shapes, and produces minimized typed semantic failures. The
execution-evidence verifier now applies this contract to both runs and includes cleanup-reset and
organization-sequence meaning in PRIMARY/REPRODUCTION comparison.

Exact Node v22.23.1 passed 53 syntax checks, 18 public dependency-free suites, the private retained-
222-record semantic suite, and the private exclusive-create failure-evidence suite. The renewed
proof inventory contains 86 files; artifact-inventory SHA-256 is
`c3f843736e6dc9024928ed9b37f19a143bd2c872f266e48d76fe51c2c8e3936f`, and canonical content-
set SHA-256 is `b13af7f9221cad17474d3a3d2c30216410f51407d0af07c55c79c6c9b0603fe3`.

Initial independent review found that the minimized diagnostic was not yet connected to a formal
retained-evidence creator. The renewed candidate preserves legacy WP-80 stop evidence, adds a
version-2 formal builder and exact schema for case/check metadata, and provides an exclusive-create
private failure writer. The same sole fresh validator reproduced the renewed eleven-path scope,
86-entry inventory, both aggregate hashes, all 53 syntax checks, all 18 public suites, both private
suites, schema-version compatibility, secret/ignore/whitespace controls, and closed gates, and
returned `PASS` with zero findings and zero mutation. Private report SHA-256 is
`6fccd4e70621fe34b35405ec4e69dc6e6ae5d58aad6d392c2ee21f5b3a1c30ea`.

Under standing completion authority, `DEC-216`, `WP81-REM-001` through `009`, `WP81-BIND-001`
through `031`, `WP81-DEC-001` through `006`, resolved `WP81-VAL-001`, the renewed 86-file proof
identity, and the exact eleven-path public/proof inventory are accepted. Publication is authorized
only for that frozen inventory after the same validator confirms the final disposition-only delta.
Static evidence is not a TP-01 runtime result and grants no dependency, runtime, network, product,
architecture, infrastructure, deployment, provider/cost, or customer/live-data authority.

## WP-81 publication and WP-82 rebinding candidate — 2026-10-09

The exact eleven-path WP-81 inventory was published at
`ecc2db47c4395d19962adcf21f45bf3ff0a0932f`, with repository tree
`5992d550601c451104f7d40e13000e0c109d7f31` and proof tree
`45369309793a803e761ace440c291c7d1ebdfe37`. WP-81 is `VERIFIED_AND_CLOSED` with static
source/control evidence only and no TP-01 runtime result.

WP-82 binds that exact publication, the 86-file inventory and aggregate identities, resolved
`WP81-VAL-001`, public/private-control hashes, all sixteen immutable stopped runs, a clean dedicated-
workspace option, the exact semantic candidate, and every remaining identity/material/runtime
gate. It creates no identity, authorization draft, run, checkout, dependency state, material,
runtime evidence, or network action.

Fresh independent validator `/root/wp82_documentation_validator` resolved `WP82-VAL-001`, then
returned `PASS` with zero mutation against the corrected exact four-path WP-82 documentation
inventory. Under standing completion authority, `DEC-217`, `TP1-SEMANTIC-REMEDIATED-BIND-001`
through `049`, `WP82-DEC-001` through `010`, the workspace and semantic-option dispositions, and
all sixteen immutable stopped attempts are accepted. Exact publication is authorized. Dependencies,
credentials/environments, preflight, images,
Docker/Compose, containers, databases, services, SQL, cleanup, proof/reproduction, network,
application coding, architecture selection, infrastructure, deployment, provider accounts/cost,
external systems, and customer/live data remain closed.

## WP-82 publication and WP-83 readiness candidate — 2026-10-09

The exact four-path WP-82 documentation inventory was published at
`3bdd75aad97fb463ddb05e02d96866522520b30d`, with repository tree
`5420a9a96172147844c26f55ea207a32dfdd643a`; the accepted proof revision remains
`ecc2db47c4395d19962adcf21f45bf3ff0a0932f` and proof tree remains
`45369309793a803e761ace440c291c7d1ebdfe37`. WP-82 is `VERIFIED_AND_CLOSED` with no runtime result.

WP-83 records `/root` only as proposed primary operator, creates exactly one fresh proposed
reproduction-validator identity `/root/wp83_reproduction_validator` with zero-authority
attestation, preserves `/root/tp01_security_review` only as proposed bounded reviewer, and creates
one ignored `DRAFT_NOT_AUTHORIZED` private authorization draft. No execution package or run exists;
all 42 action-authority flags are false and all 18 stages are proposal-only.

Fresh independent validator `/root/wp83_readiness_validator` resolved `WP83-VAL-001`, then returned
`PASS` with zero mutation against the corrected exact four-path WP-83 public inventory. Under
standing completion authority, `DEC-218`, `TP1-EXEC-SEMANTIC-BIND-001` through `056`,
`WP83-DEC-001` through `010`, the exact proposed roles, attestation, ineffective draft, and all
sixteen immutable attempts are accepted. Exact publication is authorized. Checkout, dependencies,
credentials/environments, preflight, images, Docker/Compose,
containers, databases, services, SQL, cleanup, proof/handoff/reproduction, network, application,
architecture, infrastructure, deployment, provider accounts/cost, external systems, and
customer/live data remain closed.

## WP-83 publication and WP-84 controlled result — 2026-10-09

The exact four-path WP-83 inventory was published at
`97f141b07f4c94b0c54b557c810dddf35312f52e`, with repository tree
`fc0bf41b03eaef4afacd673465810a85dfc1b99e`. The owner separately authorized WP-84 run
`wp84-2026-10-09-01` against accepted proof revision
`ecc2db47c4395d19962adcf21f45bf3ff0a0932f`.

WP-84 prepared a clean dedicated checkout, restored exactly 115 packages offline with frozen-
lockfile and ignore-scripts controls, generated fresh private material, bound new run-specific
controls, and passed fresh independent effective-authorization validation. The exact private
launcher then stopped during preflight because it could not access the authorized local Docker
Unix socket. No image inspection or retrieval, registry access, container, database, service,
proof, handoff, or reproduction occurred. No retry was performed.

Mandatory cleanup and residual verification passed after proof dependencies and the private
runtime environment were removed; no named runtime resource, listener, generated output,
credential file, or pull token remained, and the dedicated checkout was archived. The three role
reviews recommend `INCONCLUSIVE_CLOSED_NO_RETRY`. The fail-closed final verifier returned
`INCONCLUSIVE / FINAL_PREFLIGHT_STOP_PACKET / exit 2`. Fresh independent validation returned
`PASS` with no findings for the 7-entry stop seal and 13-entry private inventory.

The owner accepted the WP-84 Inconclusive disposition, all three deviations, six remediation
controls, seven result decisions, three role reviews, cleanup and residual result, fail-closed
final verifier, 7-entry stop seal, 13-entry private inventory, and independent validations exactly
as recorded. Commit and push are authorized only for the exact four-path WP-84 public inventory.
After verified publication, WP-85 may begin owner-decision documentation and static/private
planning for Docker host-access readiness only. Docker runtime, images, containers, databases,
proof execution, application coding, final architecture selection, infrastructure, deployment,
provider accounts/cost, and customer/live data remain closed.

## WP-96 controlled PASS candidate — 2026-10-10

The owner separately authorized `WP-96` run `wp96-2026-10-10-01` at published revision
`a236b35a0f95c46d1bfd52305277afd92df41942`, repository tree
`6c18cee66349bf02b77e6ed91f222b56a20a859b`, and proof tree
`1e9f75fdc1b221009bc691f54d24ca63f02c8038`. A clean dedicated checkout was used; exactly 115
packages were restored from the existing local store with offline, frozen-lockfile, and
ignore-scripts controls. The accepted PostgreSQL image was already local, so no pull token,
registry request, npm access, or other internet access occurred.

Fresh `PRE_PRIMARY` and `PRE_REPRODUCTION` validator-context receipts and external attestations
passed. PRIMARY and independent REPRODUCTION each completed all 222 manifest cases with expected
outcomes and 222 audit records. Cross-run semantic comparison matched; tracked state remained
unchanged; zero unauthorized mutation, accepted contract deviations, or operational stops were
recorded. The exact 16-entry handoff remained immutable and independently verified. All three
role reviews, the final verifier, mandatory cleanup, final residual verification, and fresh
independent 40-entry packet validation returned `PASS`.

The private environment, dependency state, bounded runtime resources, and dedicated checkout were
removed. The owner accepted the result as `PASS_CLOSED_SINGLE_USE_CONSUMED`, accepted `DEC-231`
and `WP96-DEC-001` through `007`, and authorized commit and push only for the exact frozen
four-path inventory. After verified publication, WP-97 may begin TP-01 architecture-evidence
disposition for owner-decision documentation only. Application coding, final architecture
selection, infrastructure, deployment, provider accounts/cost, and customer/live data remain
closed.

## WP-96 verified publication and WP-97 activation — 2026-10-10

The exact four-path WP-96 public inventory was committed as
`6dca2e3 WP-96: accept controlled TP-01 pass result` and published at
`6dca2e3d341e08073e57a258affa209ee265e089`, repository tree

`1e9f75fdc1b221009bc691f54d24ca63f02c8038`. Local `HEAD`, cached `origin/main`, and the live
remote main were verified at that revision. WP-96 is closed and its publication authority is
consumed.

The owner activated `WP-97 TP-01 Architecture Evidence Disposition` for owner-decision
documentation only. WP-97 proposes how the accepted bounded result may become architecture-
decision input while preserving the `NOT_READY` state of tenant and authorization decisions and
all remaining policy, specialist, provider, quality, dependency, and production gates. WP-97 does
not authorize final architecture selection, application coding, proof/runtime action,
infrastructure, deployment, provider accounts/cost, or customer/live data. No WP-97 commit or push
is authorized outside the owner's exact four-path publication boundary.

The owner accepted `DEC-232`, `TP1-EVID-DISP-001` through `018`, and `WP97-DEC-001` through
`010`; advanced `WP97-OPT-001`; rejected `WP97-OPT-002/003`; and authorized commit and push only
for documents 00, 02, 99, and 100. After verified publication, WP-98 may begin remaining-
architecture-evidence and decision-sequence documentation and option analysis only. Final
architecture selection and every implementation, infrastructure, deployment, provider/cost, and
customer/live-data gate remain closed.

## WP-97 verified publication and WP-98 activation — 2026-10-10

The exact four-path WP-97 public inventory was committed as
`f30fbf5 WP-97: accept TP-01 architecture evidence disposition` and published at

main matched. WP-97 is closed and its publication authority is consumed.

The owner activated `WP-98 Remaining Architecture Evidence and Decision Sequence` for owner-
decision documentation and option analysis only. WP-98 sequences policy baselines, proof waves,
specialist reviews, ADR packets, final-selection readiness, and the later implementation gate. It
does not authorize proof work, select architecture or dependencies, code the application, create
infrastructure/provider state, deploy, incur cost, or use customer/live data. No WP-98 commit or
push is authorized outside the owner's exact four-path publication boundary.

The owner accepted `DEC-233`, all fifteen sequencing principles, all ten sequence stages, all seven
proof waves as planning only, all six efficiency controls, and `WP98-DEC-001` through `010`;
advanced `WP98-OPT-001`; rejected options 002 through 004; and authorized commit and push only for
documents 00, 02, 100, and 101. After verified publication, WP-99 may begin authorization,
identity, and support-policy baseline documentation and option analysis only. Every proof,
architecture-selection, implementation, infrastructure, deployment, provider/cost, and
customer/live-data gate remains closed.

The owner activated `WP-103 Architecture Proof-Wave Priority and Authorization Sequence` for
owner-decision documentation only. WP-103 may reuse bounded accepted TP-01 evidence, prioritize,
combine, split, or defer the remaining proof specifications, identify exact blockers and entry/
exit boundaries, and define the minimum later authorization sequence. It does not authorize proof
preparation, proof materialization, dependencies, device or provider operation, proof execution,
architecture selection, application coding, infrastructure, deployment, provider accounts/cost,
network access, or customer/live data. The candidate inventory is documents 00, 02, 105, and 106.
The owner accepted `DEC-238`, every WP-103 reuse/specification/wave/blocker/readiness/authorization/
ADR-stage disposition, and `WP103-DEC-001` through `010`; advanced `WP103-OPT-001`; rejected
options 002 through 004; kept DigitalOcean and Google Cloud advancing for Wave D, AWS comparative
only on the recorded trigger, Wave A first, and Wave E conditionally deferred; and authorized
commit and push only for documents 00, 02, 105, and 106. After verified publication, WP-104 may
begin Wave A exact-contract and materialization-readiness documentation and proof planning only.
Proof materialization, dependencies, device operation, execution, provider/network/cost, final
architecture selection, application coding, infrastructure, deployment, and customer/live data
remain closed.

The owner activated `WP-104 Wave A Exact Contract and Proof-Only Materialization Readiness` for
documentation and proof planning only. WP-104 may propose exact Wave A hypotheses, candidate
versions, device/reviewer requirements, synthetic fixtures, cases/oracles, evidence, disposable
paths, dependency/supply-chain plan, stop/cleanup controls and later materialization-authorization
wording. It does not authorize proof files, dependencies, materialization, device operation,
execution, provider/network/cost, architecture selection, application coding, infrastructure,
deployment, or customer/live data. The candidate inventory is documents 00, 02, 106, and 107. No
proof action follows from this documentation.

The owner accepted `DEC-239`, every WP-104 candidate/contract/fixture/device/network/case/

the Wave A proof-only materialization authorization decision as documentation only. Proof files,
dependencies, materialization, devices, execution, provider/network/cost, final architecture
selection, application coding, infrastructure, deployment, and customer/live data remain closed
until separately authorized.

## WP-104 verified publication and WP-105 activation — 2026-10-10

The exact four-path WP-104 public inventory was committed as
`fb79703 WP-104: accept Wave A exact proof contract` and published at

The owner activated `WP-105 Wave A Proof-Only Materialization Authorization Decision` for owner-
decision documentation only. WP-105 may propose the exact later checkpoint authority, public and
private paths, offline dependency treatment, command classes, static validator, evidence, stop/
cleanup and result meanings. It does not authorize proof files, dependencies, materialization,
devices/emulators, builds/runs, network/provider/cost, architecture selection, application coding,
infrastructure, deployment or customer/live data. The candidate inventory is documents 00, 02,
107, and 108.

The owner accepted `DEC-240`, `WP105-MAT-001`, every WP-105 authority/path/dependency/command/
evidence/validator/stop/cleanup/result disposition, and `WP105-DEC-001` through `010`; advanced
`WP105-OPT-001`; rejected options 002 through 004; and authorized commit and push only for
documents 00, 02, 107, and 108. After verified publication, WP-106 may perform the separately
bounded offline/static materialization checkpoint exactly as accepted. Builds, emulators, devices,
installs, launches, databases, services, network shaping, proof execution/reproduction,
provider/network/cost, final architecture selection, application coding, infrastructure,
deployment and customer/live data remain closed.

## WP-105 verified publication and WP-106 controlled stop — 2026-10-10

The exact four-path WP-105 public inventory was committed as
`3e5a11e WP-105: authorize Wave A materialization decision` and published at
`3e5a11ed0b94b8a7a2edeb720baa31ca18d58000`, repository tree
`fcd4cd042825d605752be8da08bc740369071467`. Local `HEAD`, cached `origin/main`, and live remote
main matched. WP-105 is closed and its publication authority is consumed.

The owner activated `WP-106 Controlled Wave A Proof-Only Materialization and Supply-Chain Review`
at that exact revision. A clean dedicated checkout was established and existing local tools and
package artifacts were read and hashed without retrieval. The only available Flutter SDK was
`3.44.3` with bundled Dart `3.12.2`, while the accepted contract requires Flutter `3.47.0` and its
Dart `3.13` line. Exact local package directories for Drift `2.35.2`, drift_dev `2.35.0`, sqlite3
`3.7.0`, flutter_secure_storage `11.2.0`, sqflite `2.4.4+1`, and sqflite_sqlcipher `3.4.1` were
absent. The operator therefore stopped under `WP105-STOP-002` as
`STOPPED_DEPENDENCY_ABSENT` before creating the proof root, restoring dependencies, generating a
manifest or lockfile, or invoking build/device/runtime/network operations.

Exactly one fresh zero-authority validator, `/root/wp106_wavea_static_validator`, independently
confirmed the revision/tree, original six-entry seal, clean tracked state, absent proof/runtime
artifacts, tool-version drift, missing exact packages, and correct first stop. It returned `FAIL`
with `WP106-VAL-001` through `WP106-VAL-004`: the original private packet permissions were too
broad, and the packet lacked contemporaneous start/expiry/authority flags, a sealed
pre-materialization receipt, and timestamped command/operation receipts. Permissions were safely
hardened after review, but the three missing contemporaneous evidence classes cannot be recreated
or independently revalidated by the already-consumed validator. The final WP-106 candidate result
is therefore `STOPPED_STATIC_FINDING`, with the underlying dependency-absence stop preserved.

Mandatory cleanup and residual inspection found no proof tree, dependency state, build output,
device/emulator activity, process, service, database, network shaper, credential, or unbound
temporary state. The mode-restricted private packet contains twelve entries and remains ignored.
No WP-106 retry, network acquisition, or proof materialization is authorized. Public result
publication is limited to documents 00, 02, and 108.
Every build, device, runtime, proof-execution, provider/network/cost, final-architecture,
application, infrastructure, deployment, and customer/live-data gate remains closed.

The owner accepted `DEC-241`, `WP106-DEV-001`, `WP106-VAL-001` through `004`, the evidence
limitations, permission correction, cleanup/residual result, twelve-entry private inventory, and
`WP106-DEC-001` through `007`; closed WP-106 without retry; and authorized commit and push only for
documents 00, 02, and 108. After verified publication, WP-107 may begin materialization-control
remediation and offline-artifact-acquisition readiness documentation and owner-decision analysis
only. All network/download, dependency, materialization, build, device, runtime, proof-execution,
application, architecture-selection, infrastructure, deployment, provider/cost, and customer/
live-data gates remain closed.

## WP-106 verified publication and WP-107 activation — 2026-10-10

The exact three-path WP-106 public inventory was committed as
`133be6d WP-106: accept stopped Wave A materialization result` and published at
`133be6df2ed75b86c4b159e9034441eb6dbf9790`, repository tree
`47142162d8c2b4c37e0456eaea64917875572c40`. Local `HEAD`, cached `origin/main`, and live remote
main matched. The final private inventory index was corrected to mode `0600`, all eleven listed
content hashes reverified, and the twelve-entry packet remains protected by mode `0700` parent
directories. WP-106 is closed without retry and its publication authority is consumed.

The owner activated `WP-107 Wave A Materialization Control Remediation and Offline Artifact
Acquisition Readiness` for documentation and owner-decision analysis only. WP-107 may propose a
fresh non-retroactive authorization/evidence contract and separately gated methods to obtain and
seal the exact missing Flutter/package artifacts into an offline bundle. It may not access a
network, download an artifact, alter an SDK/cache, restore a dependency, create proof files, build,
touch a device, start a runtime, execute a proof, select architecture, code the application,
create infrastructure/provider state, incur cost, deploy, or use customer/live data. The
candidate public inventory is documents 00, 02, 108, and 109. No WP-107 commit or push is
authorized without later owner acceptance.

The owner accepted `DEC-242`, every WP-107 fact/control/path/command/artifact/acquisition/evidence/
stop/cleanup/risk disposition, and `WP107-DEC-001` through `010`; advanced `WP107-OPT-001`;
retained `WP107-OPT-002` only as an evidence-equivalent fallback; rejected `WP107-OPT-003/004`;
and authorized commit and push only for documents 00, 02, 108, and 109. After verified
publication, WP-108 may create only the accepted dependency-free acquisition-control tree and
mode-restricted private WP-108 evidence, bind an exact already-present Node executable, use
synthetic static fixtures, and obtain exactly one fresh zero-authority independent validation.
Network/downloads, artifact acquisition, SDK/cache mutation, dependency restoration, Wave A proof
materialization, builds, devices, runtime, proof execution, application coding, architecture
selection, infrastructure, deployment, provider/cost, and customer/live data remain closed.

## WP-107 publication, WP-108 stopped control and WP-109 remediation — 2026-10-10

The exact four-path WP-107 inventory was committed as
`f17ba04 WP-107: accept acquisition control readiness` and published at
`f17ba0474d3a40f7f46aab05226b67f720f0d574`, repository tree
`41b8cb5ae1e9b3a84ae579f27de851b7c63b7d4c`. Local `HEAD`, cached `origin/main`, and live remote
main matched. WP-107 is closed and its publication authority is consumed.

WP-108 materialized only the accepted 12-file dependency-free acquisition-control candidate and
mode-restricted private evidence. Its primary static checks passed, but the fresh independent
validator returned `STOPPED_CONTROL_EVIDENCE` with `WP108-VAL-001` through `007`: the ledger was
not bound to effective authorization, source mutations were incomplete, launcher paths/stages
were insufficiently bound, authority was not consumed, evidence schemas/tests were incomplete,
and the validator disclosed one cleaned temporary-file authority violation. The owner accepted
the stopped result, cleanup and residual verification, closed WP-108 without retry, prohibited
publication of the failed candidate, and authorized only bounded WP-109 static remediation.

WP-109 remediated the acquisition-control contract inside the exact public proof-control root and
ignored private evidence root. The primary static suite passed 18/18, the single-use authority was
consumed, the 13-entry ledger bound the exact effective-authorization hash and all 12 public paths,
the 21-entry checksum inventory and 20-entry final inventory verified, and exactly one fresh
zero-authority independent validator returned PASS with no findings. The owner accepted
`STATIC_CONTROL_REMEDIATED` and authorized publication of only the exact 12-file public control
tree.

The exact WP-109 inventory was committed as
`a073206 WP-109: remediate acquisition control contract` and published at
`a073206520caacc26c2ea5a45bd884b09a11251b`, repository tree
`2e2668933493eb4e034854dd66e799f9c9f95383`. Local `HEAD`, cached `origin/main`, and live remote
main matched; the repository was clean after publication. WP-109 is closed and its publication
authority is consumed.

The owner activated `WP-110 Wave A Offline Artifact Acquisition Exact Contract and Authorization
Readiness` for owner-decision documentation and one private ineffective authorization draft only.
WP-110 may propose exact artifact/source/network/resource/path/command/evidence/stop/cleanup
boundaries and the later acquisition authorization sequence. It may not contact a network,
download or acquire an artifact, mutate an SDK/cache, restore dependencies, build, use a device or
runtime, execute a proof, code the application, select final architecture, create infrastructure,
deploy, use provider accounts/cost, or access customer/live data. The candidate public inventory
is documents 00, 02, 109, and 110. No WP-110 commit or push is authorized without later owner
acceptance.

The owner accepted `DEC-243`, every WP-110 fact/artifact/source/limit/path/command/authorization/
evidence/stop/cleanup/blocker disposition, and `WP110-DEC-001` through `010`; advanced
`WP110-OPT-001`; retained `WP110-OPT-002` only as an evidence-equivalent fallback; rejected
options 003 and 004; accepted the ineffective private draft, observed-tool limitations and exact
eight-entry private inventory verification; and authorized commit and push only for documents 00,
02, 109 and 110. After verified publication, WP-111 may materialize and independently validate
only a dependency-free, network-disabled acquisition extension under the accepted public/private
roots. Network, metadata retrieval, downloads, artifact acquisition, SDK/cache mutation,
dependencies, builds, devices, runtime, proof execution, application coding, architecture
selection, infrastructure, deployment, provider/cost and customer/live data remain closed.

## WP-111 static acquisition-extension result — 2026-10-10

WP-111 created the exact 14-file dependency-free acquisition-extension candidate under
`proofs/wave-a-offline-artifact-acquisition/` and mode-restricted private evidence under
`internal-local/work-packages/WP-111/`. It bound only the accepted existing Node `v22.23.1`
executable, passed 15/15 static tests and the `STATIC_EXTENSION_ONLY` verifier, consumed its static
authority, sealed a verified 23-entry private inventory, and received one fresh zero-authority
independent validation PASS with no findings. No network, metadata retrieval, download, artifact
acquisition, dependency, build, device, runtime, proof, application, architecture, infrastructure,
deployment, provider/cost or customer/live-data action occurred.

The owner accepted `DEC-244`, the WP-111 result and its recorded informational placeholder-parse
limitation, and authorized publication of the formal result/governing updates plus the exact
14-file public proof-control inventory. WP-111 static success is not real-source, artifact,
dependency-closure, device or architecture evidence. Every network and execution gate remains
closed pending a separate later work package.

## WP-111 verified publication and WP-112 activation — 2026-10-14

The exact WP-111 public inventory was committed as
`42a8657 WP-111: publish static acquisition extension` and published at
`42a8657a56e2d9b674e2d030fd940ab5177bae8d`, repository tree
`4b1cb22e366dd602f14842018f20ce4fed6a7378`. Local `HEAD`, cached `origin/main`, and live remote
main matched. WP-111 is closed and its publication authority is consumed.

The owner activated `WP-112 Wave A Offline Artifact Acquisition Authorization Readiness` for
owner-decision documentation and private ineffective authorization preparation only. WP-112 may
inspect the accepted static controls, propose exact later source/stage/resource/path/role/evidence/
stop/cleanup boundaries, identify execution-readiness blockers and prepare one all-false private
draft. It may not contact a network, retrieve metadata, download or acquire an artifact, mutate an
SDK/cache, restore a dependency, build, use a device/runtime, execute a proof, code the
application, select architecture, create infrastructure, deploy, incur provider cost, or use
customer/live data. No WP-112 commit or push is authorized without later owner acceptance.

The owner accepted `DEC-245`, every WP-112 fact/source/stage/limit/path/role/authorization/
evidence/stop/cleanup disposition, and `WP112-DEC-001` through `010`; advanced
`WP112-OPT-001`; retained `WP112-OPT-004` only as an evidence-equivalent fallback; rejected
options 002 and 003; accepted the ineffective private draft and root static-validation PASS; and
authorized commit and push only for documents 00, 02, 111, and 112. After verified publication,
WP-113 may change only the disposable Wave A acquisition-control proof roots and ignored private
WP-113 evidence to materialize and independently validate an exact network launcher without
contacting a network. Every metadata, download, acquisition, SDK/cache, dependency, build, device,
runtime, proof, product, architecture, infrastructure, deployment, provider/cost, and
customer/live-data gate remains closed.

## WP-118 verified publication and WP-119 activation — 2026-10-14

The owner accepted WP-118 result `STATIC_CONTROL_REMEDIATED_VALIDATED`, every recorded finding
resolution, the 55/55 static-test PASS, both verifier PASS results, the accepted public and private
inventory hashes, and the independent revalidation PASS. The exact accepted 18-path public/proof
inventory was committed as `b438dfc WP-118: validate owner-signed acquisition controls` and
published at `b438dfc5101f49cd40925241b936539f9cf9a47f`, repository tree
`9755269bf664526d0f863be6e343ed5692f2a0ce`, with proof subtree
`17a7fd91a1966236d8214f6a1a7f7fd87e1a18ac`. Local `HEAD` and cached `origin/main` match.
WP-118 is closed; its static and publication authorities are consumed.

The owner activated `WP-119 Wave A Offline Artifact Acquisition Reauthorization Readiness` for
owner-decision documentation only. WP-119 may bind the published static evidence, distinguish the
synthetic Ed25519 fixture from later real signing authority, record remaining run-specific
identity/key/path/request/authorization requirements, and recommend the next separately gated
package. Real signing-key creation, network, downloads, artifact acquisition, SDK/cache mutation,
dependencies, builds, devices, runtime proof, application coding, final architecture selection,
infrastructure, deployment, provider/cost changes and customer/live data remain closed. No WP-119
commit or push is authorized without later owner acceptance.

## WP-119 verified publication and WP-120 activation — 2026-10-14

The owner accepted `DEC-246`, every WP-119 fact and binding, all ten WP-119 decisions and the
recorded option dispositions. The exact accepted four-path public inventory was committed as
`b7e5383 WP-119: accept acquisition reauthorization readiness` and published at
`b7e53835ce32da16d9f2ac6ebe037445690a4cc8`, repository tree
`e2db50e5635c7aa09a64b9ff979e601e6cd03564`. Live GitHub `main`, local `HEAD` and cached
`origin/main` matched. WP-119 is closed and its publication authority is consumed.

WP-120 is active for owner-decision documentation and one private ineffective authorization draft
only. It may inspect the exact published static control, propose execution identities and signing
custody, identify blockers and recommend a successor. It may not generate a real key, instantiate
a validator, perform preflight, contact a network, retrieve metadata, download/acquire artifacts,
restore dependencies, build, use devices, execute runtime proof, code the application, select
architecture, create infrastructure, deploy, incur provider cost or use customer/live data. No
WP-120 commit or push is authorized without later owner acceptance.

## WP-120 verified publication and WP-121 primary static remediation — 2026-10-14

The exact accepted WP-120 four-path public inventory was committed as
`1f4c6f0 WP-120: accept signing authority readiness` and published at
`1f4c6f0dbdf5141493a4086887518aca2ab47621`. WP-120 is closed and its publication authority is
consumed.

WP-121 remediated only the proof-control trust-root and prospective network-state bindings. The
owner accepted the primary result and separately authorized one fresh zero-authority validator.
Independent validation passed with no findings: 42/42 hashes, 59/59 tests, both public verifiers,
the exact 17-path scope and fail-closed network boundary passed. No real key or network operation
occurred. Validation authority is consumed; WP-121 stops for owner result acceptance and remains
unauthorized for commit or push.

## Private execution control

Private execution state is maintained in `internal-local/EXECUTION_CONTROL.md`. That directory is
not client-facing and is ignored by Git. It records current authorization, frozen scope, evidence,
blockers, and the next permitted gate.
