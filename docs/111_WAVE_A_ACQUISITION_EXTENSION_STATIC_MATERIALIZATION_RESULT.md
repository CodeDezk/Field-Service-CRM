## Objective and authority boundary

WP-111 materialized and independently validated the static acquisition extension required by
accepted WP-110. Work was restricted to:

- `proofs/wave-a-offline-artifact-acquisition/`; and
- ignored private evidence under `internal-local/work-packages/WP-111/`.

The package was authorized to bind an already-present exact Node executable, create dependency-free
synthetic schemas/fixtures/static controls, run the exact static test and verifier stages, seal
private evidence, consume the static authority, and obtain exactly one fresh zero-authority
independent validation after sealing.

WP-111 did not contact a network, retrieve metadata, download or acquire an artifact, mutate an
SDK/cache, restore a dependency, create a lockfile, build, access a device, start a runtime/service/
database, execute a proof, implement application code, select architecture, create infrastructure,
deploy, incur provider cost, or use customer/live data.

## Result facts

| ID | Accepted fact |
| --- | --- |
| `WP111-FACT-001` | The exact WP-110 revision and tree were verified locally and on `origin/main` before materialization. |
| `WP111-FACT-002` | The public candidate contains exactly 14 files and no dependency manifest, lockfile, SDK, acquired artifact, credential or real artifact endpoint. |
| `WP111-FACT-003` | The source-policy and metadata fixtures use only `.invalid` synthetic identities and `SOURCE_REVIEW_ONLY` classification. |
| `WP111-FACT-004` | Node `v22.23.1` at the exact recorded path and SHA-256 was the only executable binding. |
| `WP111-FACT-005` | `/usr/bin/curl`, `shasum`, `tar`, `file` and `unzip` were hash-checked only as non-executable future-tool observations. |
| `WP111-FACT-006` | The dependency-free static suite passed 15/15 and the verifier returned PASS with classification `STATIC_EXTENSION_ONLY`. |
| `WP111-FACT-007` | All network, metadata, download, acquisition, mutation, dependency, build, device, runtime, proof, product, architecture, infrastructure, deployment, provider/cost and data flags remained false. |
| `WP111-FACT-008` | The effective static authorization was consumed after primary sealing. |
| `WP111-FACT-009` | The final private inventory contains 23 verified entries, excluding itself and the two post-seal validator report files by design. |
| `WP111-FACT-010` | Exactly one fresh validator, `/root/wp111_acquisition_extension_validator`, independently returned PASS with no Critical, High, Medium or Low finding and made no mutation. |
| `WP111-FACT-011` | Cleanup/residual verification found no runtime, acquisition, quarantine, bundle, temporary or network residual. |
| `WP111-FACT-012` | No WP-111 file was committed or pushed before owner acceptance and separate publication authorization. |

## Public candidate inventory

The exact 14-file proof-control inventory is:

1. `proofs/wave-a-offline-artifact-acquisition/.gitignore`
2. `proofs/wave-a-offline-artifact-acquisition/AUTHORITY.md`
3. `proofs/wave-a-offline-artifact-acquisition/README.md`
4. `proofs/wave-a-offline-artifact-acquisition/fixtures/synthetic-metadata-commit.json`
5. `proofs/wave-a-offline-artifact-acquisition/fixtures/synthetic-source-catalog.json`
6. `proofs/wave-a-offline-artifact-acquisition/schemas/acquisition-receipt.schema.json`
7. `proofs/wave-a-offline-artifact-acquisition/schemas/artifact-inventory.schema.json`
8. `proofs/wave-a-offline-artifact-acquisition/schemas/metadata-commit.schema.json`
9. `proofs/wave-a-offline-artifact-acquisition/schemas/source-policy.schema.json`
10. `proofs/wave-a-offline-artifact-acquisition/schemas/static-authorization.schema.json`
11. `proofs/wave-a-offline-artifact-acquisition/test/acquisition-extension-static.test.mjs`
12. `proofs/wave-a-offline-artifact-acquisition/tool/contract.mjs`
13. `proofs/wave-a-offline-artifact-acquisition/tool/static-launcher.mjs`
14. `proofs/wave-a-offline-artifact-acquisition/tool/verify-extension.mjs`

Private authorization, receipts, ledgers, inventories and validator reports remain mode-restricted
and ignored under `internal-local/work-packages/WP-111/`. They must never be published.

## Recorded informational limitation

A preparatory JSON sweep encountered the intentionally empty future `final-inventory.json`
placeholder and exited before either launcher-controlled stage. It wrote nothing, contacted no
network and performed no acquisition. The exact two controlled stages then passed, and the fresh
independent validator reviewed this fact and classified it as informational, not invalidating.

## What this result does not prove

WP-111 provides static control evidence only. It does not establish:

- authoritative real upstream metadata or endpoint behavior;
- exact real artifact bytes, hashes, signatures, sizes or licenses;
- complete direct, transitive or native dependency closure;
- safe archive extraction against real inputs;
- device, offline, build, runtime or proof behavior;
- dependency acceptance, architecture selection or application implementation readiness.

## Accepted disposition and next gate

`DEC-244` accepts the WP-111 extension as independently validated static evidence and authorizes
publication of only this formal result, the affected governing records, and the exact 14-file
public proof-control inventory.

WP-111 closes after verified publication. Network and acquisition remain closed. Any later package
must separately define and obtain owner acceptance for fresh execution identities, exact real
source allowlists, resource limits, run-bound authorization, evidence, stop/cleanup controls and
the bounded metadata-first sequence before a network operation may occur.

## Verified publication and WP-112 activation

The accepted WP-111 inventory was published at revision
`42a8657a56e2d9b674e2d030fd940ab5177bae8d`, repository tree
`4b1cb22e366dd602f14842018f20ce4fed6a7378`. Local `HEAD`, cached `origin/main`, and live remote
main matched. WP-111 is closed and its publication authority is consumed.

The owner activated WP-112 for owner-decision documentation and private ineffective authorization
preparation only. WP-112 may assess whether the accepted static controls can enforce a later exact
network sequence and propose the remaining source, stage, resource, identity, evidence and cleanup
bindings. It grants no network, metadata, download, acquisition, SDK/cache mutation, dependency,
build, device, runtime, proof, application, architecture, infrastructure, deployment,
provider/cost, customer/live-data, commit or push authority.
